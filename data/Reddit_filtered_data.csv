The power loss alone from the length of the distribution cables is going to probably make this infeasible from a power generation regard.

let's do some quick math to put things in perspective:

if the stated price of 210 billion dkk is for the first phase of 3000 mw (as i understand it), that gives a price per mw of 70 million dkk.

in comparison, the new finnish olkiluoto 3 third-generation nuclear reactor costs 63.75 billion dkk, which gives a price per mw of 39.8 million dkk.

a nuclear power project that has run almost 3x over budget is still 43% cheaper than the price of this project. and i bet there will be budget overruns beyond the 210 billion dkk.

additionally, nuclear power avoids the whole issue of energy storage, which as far as i know, doesn't have a good solution yet and isn't included in this project. so what do they plan to do when the wind doesn't blow?

Når jeg skriver 'måske kun køre et par uger om året', så er det fordi det er den størrelsesorden 'hullerne i osten' udgør, når vi fremskriver VE-udbygning. Klimarådet analyserede forsyningssikkerheden sidste år, og nåede frem til at i et 'presset vejrår' får vi behov for at importere strøm i lidt under 1000 timer i 2030, svarende til knap 6 uger.

Hvordan vi så fylder de huller - det er en åben diskussion. Det bliver i praksis nok en kombination af batterilager, fleksibilitet på forbrugssiden, fleksible kraftværker og import. Og ja, så skal kraftværkerne stå klar det meste af tiden, selvom de kun skal køre nogle hundrede timer om året. Men guess what: Det gør vi allerede. Kyndby-værket, til eksempel, står bare klar. Og uanset om vi bygger atomkraft eller vindmøller, så skal vi stadig bruge den slags værker.

Jeg ser igen og igen folk hævde, at 'atomkraft ville være billigere'. Men det er bare ikke, hvad eksperter i energiøkonomi siger. Og det er ikke, hvad markedet leverer. Hvis business-casen for atomkraft vitterligt var så god, så tror jeg også vi ville se flere lande faktisk bygge atomkraft. Selv Kina, som har *ALLE* forudsætninger for billig atomkraft, udbygger sol og vind 10x hurtigere.

Mht. hvornår vi så ville kunne få atomkraft, hvis den altså var værd at bygge, så er 10 år altså næppe realistisk i Danmark. Vi taler snarere 2040. For det er jo ikke 'bare' at bygge et kraftværk. Danmark skal have de rigtige kompetencer og tiltræde de rigtige internationale aftaler og konventioner først. Hertil kommer regulering, og udvikling af projektetet, inden spaden overhovedet kan komme i jorden.

I Sverige, hvor de immervæk allerede har atomkraft, satte regeringen i 2022 i gang med udviklingen af ny atomkraft - som de håber at have klar i 2035(!). I Norge beskriver Institut for Energiteknik her, hvordan man tidligst kan få atomkraft i 2040, hvis man begynder i dag.

I øvrigt tror jeg du skal læse op på, hvad din tarif dækker over, og hvorfor den stiger. Det er korrekt, at systemtariffen, som du betaler til Energinet, indholder en komponent som skal balancere sol og vind. Men det er altså ikke den primære årsag til at du oplever en stigende tarif.",Reddit user,"so now that batteries are on the way, the energy agency is expecting around 1 gw of storage capacity by 2030. denmark already has around 16 gw of installed batteries, which translates to about 800 mwh in denmark.

when you say ""maybe only a few weeks a year"", it's because those 'small holes' in the east are what we need to fill when we're recharging our ve-building capacity. the climate council analyzed supply security last year and concluded that in an ""intensive weather year"" we'll need to import electricity around 1000 times in 2030, equivalent to about 6 weeks.

how we fill those gaps is still a topic of discussion. it's likely going to be a combination of battery storage, flexibility on the demand side, flexible power plants, and imports. and yes, even though power plants will only need to run for around 100 hours a year, they'll still be needed. take kyndby power plant as an example, which is already standing by.

i'm surprised that people keep saying 'nuclear power would have been cheaper'. what experts in energy economics say, and what the market delivers are two different things. if business cases for nuclear power were really so good, i'd expect more countries to build them. even china, which has all the prerequisites for cheap nuclear power, is building solar and wind 10 times faster.

as for when we'll have nuclear power in denmark, if it's worth building, that's not going to be as soon as 10 years. we're talking more like 2040. it's not just about building a power plant; we need the right competencies, international agreements, and regulations before we can even start digging.

in sweden, where they already have nuclear power, the government started working on new nuclear power in 2022 with plans to have it operational by 2035. in norway, the institute for energy technology estimates that you can get nuclear power as soon as 2040 if you start now.

Der er ingen løsning på problemet med hvad der skal understøtte vind og sol, hvis vi ønsker et rent klimavenligt energinet. Den nuværende løsning, og det der fortsat vil være løsningen, er sorte kraftværker, som i øvrigt udleder flere radioaktive partikler i luften end et atomkraftværk gør.

Sandheden er at vi er ligeglade med både miljø og klima herhjemme. Så længe vi kan pudse glorien foran et par vindmøller, så brænder vi gerne løs af fossile brændstoffer for at understøtte det ustabile vind- og solenergi, som både koster lige så meget hvis ikke mere, og tager lige så lang tid at bygge ud.",Reddit user,"we are securing external financing to build an energy island for 50 billion dkk that will produce as much energy as a nuclear power plant and won’t be completed until 2036. the cost and time are not the issue. if they were, we would also oppose the wind farms currently under construction.

Derudover kan man bygge et anlæg af gangen for at sikre at vi ikke rammer langt forbi det fremtidige forbrug. Jeg tror dog ""overforbrug"" vil være en fordel da vi i så fald kan blive et godt sted for el-tunge virksomheder fra hele verden.

Når det første atomkraftværk er færdigt og i drift om 20 år, så er næsten alle biler på el, så din bekymring er ikke relevant.

Hvis vi har råd til en de dyre carboncapture anlæg til 10-20 milliarder pr. styk og en energiø, så kan man eventuelt bruge de ressourcer på atomkraft først.

Know how vil man aldrig have overfor noget nyt, og sådan er det altid. Hvad vi ikke ved, det må vi lære. Så kompliceret er det som sagt heller ikke. Du skulle prøve at se de anlæg vi kører i dag rundt omkring i landet. Springet er ikke så langt som du får det til at lyde.

Vi skal selv stå for sikkerheden. Den opgave kan vi sagtens løse selv, og anlæggende skal ligge ved storbyerne hvor de er mindst til gene for den danske natur og bliver udnyttet mest energieffektivt.

Vi sørger for at projektet ikke løber over budget ved at studere de hundredevis af reaktor projekter som allerede er gennemført og anvender de samme metoder til større projekter som vi allerede bruger i dag.

Du kan ikke fjerne dårlige virksomheder fra at byde ind. Vi opstille præcise kriterier for hvad vi kræver, herunder også krav til antal succes fra tidligere opførsel af atomreaktorer.

Hvis du ikke vil tage ansvar for dit energiforbrug, så står det frit for dig at flytte til andre lande i EU. Derudover skal det nævnes at atomkraft er topsikkert og meget mindre forurenende end alle andre brændsler vi har tilgængeligt i dag, så din bekymring er både uetisk og fejlplaceret. Du skulle hellere bekymre dig om at bo i nærheden af de anlæg vi har i dag.

Ja, vi ville kunne lukke for afbrænding af fossile brændsler, på nær affald som er delvist fossil.

Vindmøller og solceller producere sjældent når vi har behov for strømmen og det betyder at vi har behov for en gigantisk overproduktion af strøm, og varmen skal vi så producere via elkedler og varmepumper med et kæmpe tab i hver omformning af energi. Hvis vi går den vej, så skal vi vente og håbe på at priserne falder helt vildt meget på særligt solceller som i øjeblikket falder betragteligt. Men det er et sats, modsat atomkraft.

Solceller og vindkraft kan ikke forbedre sig ret meget, de er tæt på at have fuld potentiel udnyttelse, men som sagt kan de potentielt blive meget billigere, men det kan kun tiden vise. Jeg har dog svært ved at se at solceller bliver så ekstremt billigt at vi har råd til en gigantisk overproduktion..",Reddit user,"exporting electricity to other countries is clearly the obvious solution to managing surplus production. additionally, building one facility at a time ensures we don't significantly overshoot future demand. overproduction, however, might actually be beneficial, as it would make denmark an attractive destination for energy-intensive businesses worldwide.  

by the time the first nuclear power plant is completed and operational in 20 years, almost all vehicles will run on electricity, making concerns about mismatched demand irrelevant.  

if we can afford expensive carbon capture facilities costing 10-20 billion dkk each and an energy island, those resources could be better spent on nuclear power first.  

lack of expertise is never a valid excuse when dealing with new technology; we simply need to learn what we don’t know. it's not as complicated as it's made out to be. you should see the facilities currently operating across the country—the leap to nuclear is far smaller than it sounds.  

we are fully capable of managing safety ourselves. nuclear facilities should be located near major cities where they would cause the least disruption to danish nature and maximize energy efficiency.  

cost overruns can be avoided by studying hundreds of completed reactor projects and applying the same methodologies we already use for large infrastructure projects.  

bad companies bidding on projects can’t be entirely avoided, but we can set precise criteria, including a track record of successful reactor constructions, to ensure quality.  

if you're unwilling to take responsibility for your energy consumption, you're free to move to another eu country. nuclear power is exceptionally safe and far less polluting than any other available fuels, making concerns about its use both unethical and misplaced. you should be more concerned about living near current facilities than future nuclear plants.  

switching to nuclear would allow us to eliminate fossil fuel burning, except for waste, which is partially fossil-based.  

wind turbines and solar panels rarely generate electricity when we need it most, requiring a massive overproduction of power. heat would then have to be generated using electric boilers and heat pumps, incurring significant energy losses at each conversion stage. if we pursue that path, we’ll have to wait and hope for drastic price reductions in solar panels, which are currently falling significantly in cost. however, relying on that is a gamble, unlike nuclear power.  

solar and wind energy cannot significantly improve their efficiency—they are already close to maximum potential. while they might become much cheaper over time, this remains uncertain. i find it hard to believe solar panels will ever become so cheap that we could afford the massive overproduction required.",10/9/2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/1fzl7ew/comment/lr2l2iw/,Reddit,Social media,2024,536.341187,1087.012817,Is nuclear power an alternative to energy islands?,True,Here

Helt sikkert der ville være modstand, men vi snakker et hypotetisk scenarie hvor man lykkedes med at gennemføre den strategisk mest optimal planløsning. Det er den mindst farlige energiform vi kender til, og derfor er det den rigtige løsning at have det tæt på storbyerne, også selvom folk i dag desværre er håbløst misinformeret af de selv samme politikere.

Nej, der er ikke mange steder at forbedre i forhold til energieffektivitet på solceller og vindmøller. De er ekstremt tæt på hypotetisk optimal udnyttelse af energien. Det er desværre fakta vi må forholde os til. Jeg ved ikke hvor du er blevet informeret om andet men sådan er det desværre. Jeg ville da også ønske at der var mere energi i solens stråler, men det er som det er. Det er korrekt at prisen allerede er lav på solceller ud fra en historisk betragtning. Blandt andet derfor er det svært at forestille at prisen kan blive 10 gange lavere så det kan blive en seriøs løsning, så vi kan overproducere nok til at det kan dække hele vores forbrug.

Vindmøller falder ikke i pris mere, så den kan vi allerede droppe til at dække hele vores forbrug da det ville kræve så mange vindmøller at de ville have en max effekt på 10 gange vores peak forbrug og dermed ville blive ekstremt dyrt.

Det er korrekt at der altid er vind, bare ikke nok. Produktion svinger ekstremt meget på vind. Prøv selv at følg med her: https://energinet.dk/energisystem_fullscreen/
tjek historiske data fra f.eks. d. 4-10-2024 og derefter d. 7-10-2024.
Det er omkring faktor 10 i forskel på forbruget og de er allerede spredt godt rundt i de områder hvor det kan lade sig gøre at sætte dem op.

there would undoubtedly be resistance, but this is a hypothetical scenario in which the most strategically optimal plan is successfully implemented. nuclear power is the least dangerous energy source we know, making it the right solution to place near major cities—even if, unfortunately, people today are hopelessly misinformed by the very politicians who influence these decisions.  

it’s true that there’s little room for improvement in the energy efficiency of solar panels and wind turbines; they are already extremely close to their hypothetical maximum efficiency. that’s a fact we must accept. i don’t know where you might have been told otherwise, but sadly, that’s the reality. i also wish there were more energy in the sun’s rays, but it is what it is. while the price of solar panels is already low from a historical perspective, it’s hard to imagine that it will drop tenfold to make overproduction a viable solution to meet all of our energy needs.  

wind turbines are no longer decreasing in price either, so we can already rule them out as a solution to cover all our energy consumption. meeting the demand would require so many wind turbines that their maximum output would be ten times our peak consumption, making them extremely expensive.  

yes, there is always some wind, just not enough. wind production fluctuates significantly. check for yourself: \url{https://energinet.dk/energisystem_fullscreen/}. look at the historical data, for instance, from october 4, 2024, and then october 7, 2024. you’ll see a factor of ten difference in production, even though the turbines are already spread across all viable locations.

Og så store anlæg ender altid med at koste væsentligt mere end man regner med.

Derudover er det uafprøvet teknologi i den størrelsesorden. Vi ved ikke om det virker, og om det kan lade sig gøre at drive det så det er rentabelt. Vi risikerer en gigantisk underskudsforretning som vi er nødt til at finansierer driften af med milliardunderskud, efter sunken cost metoden.

Det største problem efter min mening er dog at den kalkule man har lavet for at vurdere rentabiliteten, er lavet ud fra nutidens el-priser. Falder el-priserne i fremtiden, så falder projektets rentabilitet til jorden og vi ender med en fiasko, og lige nu er mange af vore nabolande ved at investere i a-kraft, hvoraf nogle er planlagt taget i drift omkring eller inden energiøerne tages i drift. Bl.a. vil Polen bygge tre a-kraftværker, svenskerne vil også bygge nye værker, i Norge overvejer man det, England har lige færdiggjort et og vil bygge flere, og mon ikke Tyskland ender med det også, befolkningen har i hvert fald fortrudt at de har lukket de eksisterende.

Så økonomien i energiøerne er meget tvivlsom i det fremtidige el-marked, teknologien er uafprøvet, og Danmark burde i stedet overveje at kigge på noget a-kraft, evt. ved at købe os ind på et af de kommende værker i et af vore nabolande.
June 28 2023",Reddit user,"there are numerous issues with the energy islands. for one, the project relies on economic calculations that never hold up—they are always overly optimistic because everyone involved has a vested interest in getting the project approved. large-scale projects like this always end up costing significantly more than estimated.  

furthermore, the technology for energy islands on this scale is untested. we don’t know if it will work or if it’s even possible to operate it profitably. there’s a significant risk of it becoming a massive financial loss that we’ll have to subsidize with billions annually, following the sunk-cost fallacy.  

the biggest problem, in my view, is that the profitability calculations are based on today’s electricity prices. if electricity prices drop in the future, the project’s viability collapses, and we’re left with a failure. right now, many of our neighboring countries are investing in nuclear power, with some plants scheduled to come online around the same time or even before the energy islands. poland plans to build three nuclear power plants, sweden is building new ones, norway is considering it, england has just completed one and plans to build more, and i wouldn’t be surprised if germany follows suit—their population already regrets shutting down the existing plants.

Jeg syntes bestemt man burde begynde at bruge sådanne systemer som pilot-projekt i små byer som første skridt, så kan man også begynde at begrænse mængden af gas vi bruger så man nemmere kan konvertere resten af vores gas forbrug til grønne alternativer som biogas og hvad ved jeg.

this means the project will involve 10gw and an energy island. while this solution is still significantly cheaper than the nuclear power plant used in the example, it can still be agreed that it is too expensive.

using u/reddit_user's figure of 7.5 million kroner per mw and the 10gw capacity, the cost should be around 75 billion kroner for this project. there is nothing wrong with offshore wind turbines, but there is something wrong with this particular project.

edit: by the way, 15 mw wind turbines do not exist yet. as mentioned in the article i linked, this must be the size that is intended to be built. the largest turbine i know of is ge's haliade-x at 13 mw. so i am curious which turbines will be used when the first phase of the project begins.",2/4/2021,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/lcdy1k/comment/gm09azl/,Reddit,Social media,2021,1617.490723,192.589417,Are there more cost-effective ways to reach the emissions targets?,True,negative

Er par andre ting der ikke er fair sammenligninger er fx:

    vindmøllerne kommer ikke til at producere deres maksimal kapacitet hele tiden. Det kan atomkraftværket. Desuden er der en værdi i at atomkraftværket kan producere strømmen når du har brug for den.

    Jeg har også sammenlignet budgetterede omkostninger med faktiske omkostninger. Med mindre de sætter vejdirektoratet til at bygge projektet kommer der til at være budgetoverskridelser.

Det, plus det du nævner, er gode ting at være klar over, men nu har jeg altså kun lavet en 10 minutters redditkommentar og ikke en dybdegående analyse :)

some other things that aren't fair comparisons include:

- wind turbines won't produce their maximum capacity all the time, whereas a nuclear power plant can. moreover, there is value in the fact that the nuclear power plant can generate electricity whenever it is needed.
- i have also compared budgeted costs with actual costs. unless they assign the project to the road directorate, there will be budget overruns.

Og så store anlæg ender altid med at koste væsentligt mere end man regner med. 

Derudover er det uafprøvet teknologi i den størrelsesorden. Vi ved ikke om det virker, og om det kan lade sig gøre at drive det så det er rentabelt. Vi risikerer en gigantisk underskudsforretning som vi er nødt til at finansierer driften af med milliardunderskud, efter sunken cost metoden. 

Det største problem efter min mening er dog at den kalkule man har lavet for at vurdere rentabiliteten, er lavet ud fra nutidens el-priser. Falder el-priserne i fremtiden, så falder projektets rentabilitet til jorden og vi ender med en fiasko, og lige nu er mange af vore nabolande ved at investere i a-kraft, hvoraf nogle er planlagt taget i drift omkring eller inden energiøerne tages i drift. Bl.a. vil Polen bygge tre a-kraftværker, svenskerne vil også bygge nye værker, i Norge overvejer man det, England har lige færdiggjort et og vil bygge flere, og mon ikke Tyskland ender med det også, befolkningen har i hvert fald fortrudt at de har lukket de eksisterende. 

Så økonomien i energiøerne er meget tvivlsom i det fremtidige el-marked, teknologien er uafprøvet, og Danmark burde i stedet overveje at kigge på noget a-kraft, evt. ved at købe os ind på et af de kommende værker i et af vore nabolande.",Reddit user,"we believe there are many problems with the energy islands. for example, the project is based on economic calculations that always turn out to be overly optimistic because everyone involved has an interest in the project being approved. large-scale projects like this always end up costing significantly more than initially anticipated.

– Det är vindkraftteknik 2.0, säger Jes Hansen, divisionschef på Swecos kontor i Köpenhamn.

Danskarna gör det igen. År 1991 var Danmark det först i världen med att bygga en vindkraftpark till havs. Nu, 30 år senare, tar danska staten steget längre för att få sin första ”energiö”, som ska vara ett nav för tusentals havsbaserade vindkraftsturbiner.

Ön, åtta mil utanför Jyllands västkust, blir det största byggprojektet i dansk historia och ska kunna fördela el till tio miljoner europeiska hushåll. Ön ska till en början omfatta en storlek på cirka 30 fotbollsplaner, cirka 15 hektar, och slutkostnaden beräknas kring 290 miljarder svenska kronor.

Svenska teknikkonsultföretaget Sweco har fått i uppdrag att ta fram ett tekniskt underlag för hur energiön ska byggas. Ordern är värd mellan 500 till 830 miljoner kronor för Sweco, som ska vara teknisk rådgivare till projektet.

– Vi har lång erfarenhet av vindkraft till havs där vi tagit energin till land via kabel. Det här är havsbaserad vindkraft 2.0. Och att nu bygga en energiö innebär att vi kan hantera elproduktionen på helt andra sätt, säger Jes Hansen, direktör på Sweco i Danmark.

Med sådana här energiöar kan vindturbinerna placeras betydligt längre från land och bli mer effektiva när det gäller att fördela elproduktionen till flera länder. Hur energin ska kunna lagras är ännu inte bestämt. En svårighet är också hur den konstgjorda ön ska klara av Nordsjöns 25-metersvågor.

– Vågornas storlek är en stor utmaning. Vi är sedan tidigare vana vid att projektera borrplattformar högt ovanför vattenytan men den här ön ska byggas i havsnivå. Energiön ligger i framkant av teknikutvecklingen och det kommer att bli intressant att följa utvecklingen av energiöverföring och lagring i framtiden, säger Tore Lucht, chef för havs- och geologiska avdelningen på Sweco i Köpenhamn.

Centralt för hur energiöar ska byggas är den så kallade power-to-x-tekniken som anses vara en nyckelfaktor för att göra vindkraftselen leveranssäker. När det är mycket vind, men efterfrågan på elektricitet är liten, kan överskottet omvandlas till exempel till väte och till klimatneutrala bränslen, som kan användas i flygplan, fartyg och inom tung industri.

Den konstgjorda ön är en av två energiöar som Danmark kommer att etablera som en del av den gröna omvandlingen av energisektorn. Danska folketinget har också beslutat att bygga en mindre ”energiö” för vindkraft på Bornholm i Östersjön, men den nya energiön väster om Jylland är betydligt större och hit ska vindkraft med en produktion på 3-10 gigawatt anslutas. En gigawatt motsvarar behovet av drygt en miljon hushåll. Fullt utbyggd så kommer energiön utanför Jylland att ge 45 Twh (terawattimmar) per år, vilket ska jämföras med Forsmarks tre kärnkraftverk som ger cirka 25 Twh/år. Fler länder än Danmark ligger också i startgroparna för att bygga liknande energiöar.

Ön är avsedd att täcka elförbrukningen för tre miljoner hushåll, men planen är att utvidga ön så att den med tiden når en storleksordning som motsvarar 64 fotbollsplaner och kommer att kunna täcka elförbrukningen för tio miljoner hushåll i Danmark, Tyskland och Nederländerna.",Reddit user,"the swedish engineering consultancy company sweco is tasked with designing the world's first ""energy island,"" a groundbreaking project with the capacity to supply electricity to 10 million european households. this project, eight kilometers off the west coast of jutland, represents a major leap forward in offshore wind power, following denmark's pioneering efforts in 1991 as the first country to build an offshore wind farm. 

the energy island will act as a hub for thousands of offshore wind turbines, enabling electricity distribution across multiple countries. initially spanning 15 hectares (approximately 30 football fields), the artificial island's construction cost is estimated at 290 billion swedish kronor. the island is intended to support the green energy transition by providing 3-10 gigawatts of electricity, with the potential to scale up to 45 terawatt-hours annually, surpassing the output of forsmark’s three nuclear reactors. it will serve denmark, germany, and the netherlands, ultimately expanding to cover an area equivalent to 64 football fields.

one of the key challenges lies in handling the north sea's 25-meter waves, as the island will be constructed at sea level. additionally, the project will employ power-to-x technology, which is critical for stabilizing wind power output. surplus energy generated during high wind periods and low electricity demand can be converted into hydrogen or climate-neutral fuels for use in aviation, shipping, and heavy industry.

this energy island west of jutland is one of two planned by denmark, alongside a smaller version on bornholm in the baltic sea. these projects mark denmark's ambitious commitment to renewable energy and set the stage for technological advancements in energy storage and offshore wind power distribution.",8/7/2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/wibk6n/v%C3%A4rldens_f%C3%B6rsta_energi%C3%B6_nytt_uppdrag_f%C3%B6r_svenskt/?rdt=55728,Reddit,Social media,2022,853.131958,120.258842,Power-to-X and energy storage,True,Positive

Danmark är Europas och världens ledande land inom vindkraft.

2019 producerade Danmarks vindkraft el motsvarande 47 procent av landets totala elförbrukning. Vindkraften stod då för sammanlagt drygt 16 TWh, vilket ändå är 9 Twh mindre än vad som produceras i svenska Forsmarks tre kärnkraftsreaktorer.

I Danmark, vars yta motsvaras av storleken på landskapet Jämtland, fanns 2019 drygt 6 000 vindkraftverk. Det kan jämföras med Sverige som 2021 hade drygt 4 300 vindkraftverk.

Svenska vattenfall har flera vindkraftverkprojekt till havs i Danmark, bland andra Horns Rev 3 som är störst i Danmark. Vattenfall bygger också Kriegers Flak samt Vesterhav Syd och Nord, som enligt planen ska vara i full drift senast vid utgången av 2023

2019 sysselsatte den danska vindkraftbranschen drygt 32.000 heltidsanställda. Danska Vesta, ett av världens största vindkraftsföretag, omsatte 2021 drygt 160 miljarder kronor.

Power-to-X – ska ge energi när vinden mojnar
Power-to-X innebär omvandling av elkraft till någonting annat som innebär att vindkraften kan leverera el även när det inte blåser.

I och med den ökade produktionen av förnybar energi från källor som sol och vind kommer det att finnas tillfällen när det genereras mer kraft än vad som behövs. Det kommer att leda till ökad efterfrågan på energilagring, där Power-to-X-process blir ett sätt att omvandla överskottsenergin till något annat (gas, syntetiskt bränsle, rörelse med mera).

by 2019, denmark had over 6,000 wind turbines, which is significant compared to sweden's 4,300 wind turbines in 2021. swedish energy company vattenfall operates several offshore wind projects in denmark, including the largest, horns rev 3. other projects include kriegers flak and vesterhav syd and nord, which are expected to be fully operational by the end of 2023.

in 2019, the danish wind energy sector employed around 32,000 full-time workers. danish company vestas, one of the world's largest wind turbine manufacturers, generated over 160 billion sek in revenue in 2021.

power-to-x technology is a key solution for ensuring wind power remains available even when the wind does not blow. power-to-x converts excess electricity generated from renewable sources like wind and solar into other forms of energy, such as gas, synthetic fuels, or stored energy, helping to meet energy demand even during periods of low wind or solar production.",8/7/2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/sweden/comments/wibk6n/v%C3%A4rldens_f%C3%B6rsta_energi%C3%B6_nytt_uppdrag_f%C3%B6r_svenskt/?rdt=55728,Reddit,Social media,2022,931.817871,880.888306,Power-to-X and energy storage,True,neither

Over het algemeen lijkt wind goedkoper te zijn dan kernenergie. Batterijen worden met de dag goedkoper en er zijn meer oplossingen dan alleen de bekende chemische batterijen zoals een li-ion.

Investeringen in het E-Net brengt ook kosten met zich mee. Dit is niet alleen omdat we op een andere manier energie opwekken maar vooral omdat we meer elektriciteit gaan gebruiken.

Een goede baseload van kernenergie is uiteraard zeer handig. Frankrijk profiteert nog van de goedkope bouw van kerncentrales 30 jaar geleden. In de tussentijd is regelgeving zo streng geworden dat het enorm duur is geworden. Of het in het huidig klimaat dus nog relatief goedkoop kan is nog maar de vraag.",Other,"belgianhorror: are you certain that nuclear energy is cheaper? recent nuclear power plants built in europe and the u.s. have turned out to be at least three times more expensive than initially expected. here are three european examples:  

- olkiluoto (1.6 gw): construction took 17 years (2005–2022). estimated cost was €3 billion, but the final cost was €11 billion (€6.8 billion/gw).  
- flamanville (1.65 gw): construction took 16 years (2007–2023). estimated cost was €3.3 billion, but it ended up costing €12 billion (€7.2 billion/gw).  
- hinkley point c (3.2 gw): estimated construction time was 8 years (2018–2026). initial cost estimate was €18 billion, but it is now expected to exceed €35 billion (€11 billion/gw).  

in the u.s., examples include watts bar unit 2 (23 years, €4 billion/gw) and vogtle units 3 and 4 (10 years, €23 billion/gw).  

by comparison, the current belgian offshore wind farm cost around €8–9 billion for 2.26 gw of output, which is approximately €4 billion/gw.  

wind energy generally appears to be cheaper than nuclear. battery costs are decreasing daily, and there are alternatives beyond conventional chemical batteries like lithium-ion.  

investments in the energy grid are inevitable, not just because of the shift in energy sources but also due to increased electricity demand.  

while a reliable nuclear baseload is undoubtedly valuable, france benefits from nuclear plants built cheaply 30 years ago. since then, stricter regulations have made nuclear construction extremely costly. whether nuclear energy can remain relatively affordable under current conditions is highly uncertain.",1/2/2025,https://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/1hs262r/is_er_nu_eigenlijk_behalve_tine_tegen_kernenergie/?show=original,Reddit,Social media,2025,1099.187378,-216.781326,Is nuclear power an alternative to energy islands?,True,Neither

Det virker som en meget fordelagtig vej at gøre det på for selv hvis der skete et problem er det relativt nemt at begrænse problemet og så kan man lære af problemet og udvikle designet til at være endnu bedre, og disse værker har i forvejen meget simple designs med høj pålidelighed så de nærmest er passive. Jeg syntes bestemt man burde begynde at bruge sådanne systemer som pilot-projekt i små byer som første skridt, så kan man også begynde at begrænse mængden af gas vi bruger så man nemmere kan konvertere resten af vores gas forbrug til grønne alternativer som biogas og hvad ved jeg.

this approach seems very advantageous because, even if an issue were to occur, it would be relatively easy to contain, and lessons could be learned to improve future designs. these plants already feature simple, highly reliable designs that are essentially passive. i believe these systems should be piloted in small towns as a first step, which would also help reduce the amount of gas used. this would make it easier to transition the remaining gas consumption to green alternatives like biogas. if we are to challenge any industries, it should likely be the natural gas companies, as they currently provide much of denmark's non-green electricity and are highly profitable.

Danmarks statsminister Mette Frederiksen (S) hade bjudit in regeringschefer från åtta länder kring Östersjön. De åtta blev dock bara sex sedan Sveriges Magdalena Andersson och Tysklands Olaf Scholz skickat sina energiministrar.

Huvuduppgiften var att skriva under ett ambitiöst avtal om att sjufaldiga produktionen av havsbaserad vindkraft i Östersjön under de närmsta sju åren.

Men redan innan mötet började dominerades det av elpriser – och vad EU-kommissionen vill göra åt skyhöga prisnivåer.

Ursula von der Leyen vill nämligen sänka elpriserna med ett enkelt handgrepp: genom att ändra dagens ""marginalprissättning"".

Det påminner om de åtgärder som Vänsterpartiet presenterat i den svenska valrörelsen – och som energiexperten Bengt Ekenstierna utvecklat i sin så kallade Bekenmodell för lägre svenska elpriser.

Det är en åtgärd som betecknats som politisk omöjlig av den svenska regeringen, som gått in för elprisstöd snarare än sänkta priser.

Nu kan EU-kommissionens ordförande göra politiska förändringar möjliga. Ursula von der Leyen har de senaste dagarna talat sig varm för sänkta elpriser i alla Europas länder genom att låta nationella elaktörer byta från en prissättningsmodell till en annan.

– De våldsamma ökningarna av elpriserna har blottlagt begränsningar i själva utformningen av elmarknaden. Därför arbetar vi nu fram en strukturreform, sade hon i slovenska Bled häromdagen.

De beskeden upprepade hon i Köpenhamn på tisdagen. Enligt Ursula von der Leyen utvecklades den europeiska elmarknaden under en annan tid och under andra omständigheter än de som gäller idag.

– Vår prismekanism är inte längre ändamålsenlig. Vi behöver en ny marknadsmodell för elektricitet som fungerar och återger oss balans, säger hon.

EU-länderna tillämpar sedan flera år marginalprissättning på el. Liknande prismodeller gäller för koppar, järn och andra råvaror, men är sårbara när elpriserna påverkas av Vladimir Putins gaskrig mot Europa.

Marginalpris innebär att alla elproducenter i ett och samma land eller elområde får samma elpris i varje givet ögonblick. Systemet togs fram för att gynna transparens och underlätta en övergång till grön el. Den speglar inte en verklig balans mellan tillgång och efterfrågan.

Marginalpris ger just nu den som producerar billig vindkraft samma skyhöga ersättning som den som producerar dyr gasel. I Skåne ger den en vindkraftsägare i Svalöv samma höga ersättning per kWh som Svenska kraftnät betalar för dyr litauisk importel.

Rysslands gaskrig sätter prissystemet under press. Tio EU-länder har gjort uppror. Spanien, Portugal, Grekland, Frankrike, Italien och Belgien vill göra undantag från prissättningen. I vissa fall har de föregripit Bryssels ja.

Även Polen och Tjeckien efterlyser ny prissättning. Nordens länder har hittills funnit sig i att prissättningen ger orimligt dyr el och har istället gått in för skattesubventionerade stödmodeller.

Den svenska och danska regeringen fick på tisdagen en unik chans att lämna egna synpunkter till Ursula von der Leyen för att påverka en kommande justering av elpriserna.

Enligt Ursula von der Leyen bör elpris inte längre definieras utifrån dyraste elkälla. Hon har inte gett mer exakta besked än så, men en justerad prismodell kan presenteras redan den 9 september vid ett extramöte med EU:s energiministrar.

Energitoppmötet i Köpenhamn har haft ett mer förutbestämt resultat. De åtta deltagarländerna ska öka maxeffekten för havsbaserad vindkraft i Östersjön från 2,8 till 19,6 GW fram till 2030. Ett liknande avtal finns för Nordsjön.

Sverige och Danmark ska bidra till den ambitiösa utbyggnaden. Det finns ett tiotal svenska vindkraftsprojekt med en maxeffekt på totalt 5,2 GW enbart på havsgrund utanför Skånes kuster. Bland annat på Kriegers flak söder om Trelleborg och Sjollen väster om Lomma.

Danmark har flera vindkraftsprojekt på gång i södra Öresund, men framför allt på Bornholm. Där ska maxeffekten på vindkraft öka med 3 GW med en enorm landbaserad ""Energiø"" på öns sydkust.",Reddit user,"the european electricity pricing mechanism, based on marginal pricing, is fundamentally flawed and no longer suitable for today's energy market conditions. marginal pricing causes all electricity producers, regardless of production costs, to receive the same price as the most expensive electricity source in use. this results in excessively high profits for low-cost producers such as wind farms while consumers face unreasonably high energy bills.

the energy island project in denmark, particularly on bornholm, is a significant opportunity to expand offshore wind capacity in the baltic sea, increasing capacity from 2.8 gw to 19.6 gw by 2030. this expansion is essential for increasing renewable energy production, yet the current pricing model undermines the affordability of electricity.

i support the shift away from marginal pricing, as proposed by ursula von der leyen, and favor a pricing system that reflects the actual balance between supply and demand rather than being distorted by expensive gas imports. a pricing reform should prioritize affordable energy for consumers while maintaining incentives for renewable energy investment. additionally, denmark's focus on offshore wind expansion through the energy island initiative aligns well with the need for a sustainable energy transition, but only if pricing mechanisms are adjusted to ensure fairness and market stability.",9/2/2022,https://www.reddit.com/r/svenskpolitik/comments/x3wrgd/s%C3%A5_kan_eukommissionens_ordf%C3%B6rande_s%C3%A4nka_ditt/,Reddit,Social media,2022,397.750214,620.475891,Electricity markets and bidding zones,True,positive

Så det du ser her (i den aktuelle video, men iøvrigt også i nyere pressemeddelelser) er et smukt eksempel på politisk spin.

what you see here (in the referenced video and recent press releases) is an example of political spin. the result is that denmark is financing the largest construction project in its history to export most of the electricity produced to neighboring countries at day rates.

this mandatory export and the confusing press messaging have several downsides. first, power-to-x project leaders are left in a difficult position. more importantly, it makes it harder for denmark to meet its decarbonization goals, which require access to large amounts of green electricity—a need the islands do not address. additionally, funds that could have been invested in infrastructure, electrification, heat pumps, and other initiatives for decarbonization are now tied up in this export-focused project. this is especially unfortunate because denmark is already a net importer of green electricity, meaning the country does not produce enough for its own needs.

on the positive side, it is beneficial that the eu has decided to strengthen the electricity grid in europe and allocated significant funds for this purpose. for example, the cobra cable to the netherlands (operational since last autumn) and the viking cable to the uk (underway but not yet completed) were financed through eu strategic funds, with more connections planned. unfortunately, the same eu framework has also introduced mandatory export rules.

så er det grønne i dette projekt til dels tvivlsomt, da der skal gå mange år før den går i nul så at sige.

men det store fordel ligger i at det gør det nemmere at flytte den grønne strøm der så bliver produceret i forskellige områder i EU.

f.eks. er der så vidt jeg ved store udfordringer at flytte dansk vindstrøm(eller Svensk/norsk hydro) mere syd end nordtyskland, da der er så stor forskel i frekvensen i højspændingnen at de ikke kan, så derfor handler Danmark, Norge og Svergie meget med strømmen, så når den ene har overskud, og anden underskud går det frem og tilbage.

dette projekt vil gøre det muligt at flytte denne grønne energi hen til steder der er behov for den, og ikke bare at flytte vand tilbage op i reservoire i hydro anlæg når der er overproduktion. og så vil man også producere brint når der er overproduktion på øen.

så selve øen vil ikke være grøn, da det er så ydgiftstung at lave den, men det vil være en kæmpe forbedring af energi situationen i EU, så når der er overproduktion et sted, så kan man faktisk bruge det steder der ellers ville bruge fossile energi metoder.

however, the main advantage lies in making it easier to transfer the green electricity that will be produced in various parts of the eu. 

for example, to my knowledge, there are significant challenges in moving danish wind power (or swedish/norwegian hydroelectric power) further south than northern germany due to large differences in frequency in high-voltage transmission. as a result, denmark, norway, and sweden engage in extensive electricity trading—when one country has a surplus and another has a deficit, electricity flows back and forth.

this project will make it possible to move this green energy to areas where it is needed, rather than just shifting water back into reservoirs in hydro plants when there’s overproduction. additionally, hydrogen will be produced on the island when there’s excess energy.

while the island itself may not be green due to the high costs involved in creating it, it will be a massive improvement to the eu’s energy situation. when there is overproduction in one area, it can actually be used where fossil fuels would otherwise be used.

The power loss alone from the length of the distribution cables is going to probably make this infeasible from a power generation regard.

This is going to cost way more money than if the same was done closer to shore, or on-land. This smells like a scam to investors to me.

the significant power loss from the long distribution cables alone will likely make this project unfeasible from a power generation perspective.

furthermore, constructing this far from shore, rather than closer to land or on land, will require far more investment, making it considerably more expensive.
