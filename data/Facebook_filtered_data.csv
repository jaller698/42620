FIASKOEN forekommer total. Og dansk energi- og klimapolitiks klyngen til vind som landets redning, st√•r udstillet som en vinterbader, der har fortrudt midt p√• badebroen.

Det st√∏rste udbud af en hjemlig havm√∏llepark nogensinde med opf√∏relse af gigantiske vindm√∏ller i Nords√∏en svarende til energiforbruget for mere end halvdelen af danskerne har nul bydere. Ingen. Ikke engang statens eget selskab √òrsted har budt.

Eller for den sags skyld energi-iglerne fra Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.

DET BLOTL√ÜGGER ikke bare, hvor mislykket forretningsmodellen med al risiko lagt hos byderen og krav om √•rlig koncessionsbetaling til den danske stat er. Det demaskerer ogs√• det selvgode ansigt p√• dansk klimapolitik.

Udbuddet om at opf√∏re ni gigawatt havvind ‚Äì med de tre gigawatt i f√∏rste budrunde - blev vedtaget af Folketinget i maj 2023. Og politikernes ensidige satsning p√• vind er s√•ledes nu ved at tabe pusten.

HAVM√òLLEPARKER er rasende dyre at opf√∏re. Ingen tidligere prisestimater st√•r tiln√¶rmelsesvis m√•l med, hvor omkostningskr√¶vende man i dag kan se parkerne blive.

Samtidig har Danmark - og resten af Europa for den sags skyld ‚Äì et altoverskyggende problem med at opbygge billig og forsyningssikker energi. Endda i en grad s√• det efterh√•nden synes mere presserende end at n√• klimam√•lene.

Det mislykkede udbud har selvsagt store konsekvenser for andre og tilh√∏rende energiplaner. Politikerne planlagde indtil for nylig ogs√• to ‚Äôenergi√∏er‚Äô. Henholdsvis i Nords√∏en og p√• Bornholm.

Her skulle vind forvandles til str√∏m svarende til gr√∏n str√∏m til 13,3 europ√¶iske husstande. Den ene energi√∏ i Nords√∏en er udskudt p√• ubestemt tid.

Den bliver for dyr.

Og er ‚ÄôEnergi√∏ Bornholm‚Äô ikke tillige sp√•et at v√¶re urentabel, m√• den v√¶re det nu. 8,7 milliarder kroner til opf√∏relsen af den skulle hentes p√• indt√¶gter fra havvind i Nords√∏en.

DET HAR IKKE V√ÜRET begavet at satse n√¶sten alt p√• havvind. Det har v√¶ret uklogt s√• religi√∏st at bekende sig til vindm√∏ller og forsage eksempelvis atomkraft, som Socialdemokratiet i √•rtier har gjort i jagten p√• CO2-neutral energi. Problemet er naturligvis, at vi alle st√•r kuldsk√¶re i slipvinden fra den sm√¶kkede d√∏r i udbudsrunden.

Og vi ved alle, hvem der kommer til at betale for blamagen.",Facebook user,"the cold shower  

the failure seems total. denmark‚Äôs energy and climate policy, clinging to wind as the country‚Äôs savior, is now exposed like a winter swimmer regretting halfway down the pier.  

the largest tender ever for a domestic offshore wind farm, involving the construction of giant turbines in the north sea to supply energy equivalent to the consumption of more than half of denmark‚Äôs population, has received zero bids. none. not even from the state-owned company √∏rsted.  

nor from energy profiteers like copenhagen infrastructure partners.  

this reveals not just how flawed the business model is‚Äîwith all risks placed on the bidder and the demand for annual concession payments to the danish state‚Äîbut also the self-righteous face of danish climate policy.  

the tender for building nine gigawatts of offshore wind‚Äîthree gigawatts in the first round‚Äîwas approved by parliament in may 2023. but the politicians‚Äô one-sided reliance on wind power is now losing momentum.  

offshore wind farms are outrageously expensive to construct. none of the earlier price estimates come close to reflecting the actual costs that are now evident.  

meanwhile, denmark‚Äîand europe as a whole‚Äîfaces an overwhelming problem: building cheap and reliable energy. this issue is becoming more urgent than meeting climate targets.  

the failed tender has, of course, significant consequences for other related energy plans. until recently, politicians also planned two 'energy islands'‚Äîone in the north sea and one on bornholm. these were meant to convert wind into electricity, providing green power to 13.3 million european households.  

the north sea energy island has been postponed indefinitely. it‚Äôs too expensive.  

and if 'energy island bornholm' wasn‚Äôt already predicted to be unprofitable, it must be now. the 8.7 billion kroner for its construction was supposed to come from revenues generated by wind farms in the north sea.  

it was not wise to bet almost everything on offshore wind. it has been foolish to adhere so religiously to wind turbines while rejecting alternatives like nuclear power, as the social democrats have done for decades in pursuit of co2-neutral energy.  

the problem now is that we‚Äôre all left shivering in the draft of the slammed door from the tender round.

for offshore wind from 30-50km at sea:
- same starting power but 10-12% losses from ac/dc - dc/ac conversion plus grid transmission

for energy island with power-to-x storage:
the total losses are 75-85% through multiple steps:

2. Nogle af de st√∏rste fortalere for vindenergi siger det er en √∏konomisk katastrofe.

3. Brian Vad (professor) siger at det hele er skruet forkert sammen.

4. En af grundene til at det er s√• dyrt er ogs√• at man ikke har opfundet alt teknologien endnu.

5. Regeringens vism√¶nd siger at projektet er √∏konomisk uholdbart.

Hvorfor s√• alt det st√•hej? Virksomheders prim√¶re form√•l er at tjene penge. Pumper staten en masse skattekroner i det t√•belige projekt er der selvf√∏lgelig en mulighed for at der vil falde penge af til de bornholmske virksomhed, som nu klager deres n√∏d.

Men er det nok til at ‚Äúredde‚Äù Bornholm? Nej! Det viser de f√• rapporter, som er lavet om emnet.

Faktisk kan Bornholm forbedre sin √∏konomi mere ved at have 20 f√¶rre dyre enkeltsager end hvis hele energi√∏eventyret bliver realiseret?

Skal vi s√• smadre velf√¶rden for en relativt lille oms√¶tning, som giver social deroute og √∏gede udgifter? Nej tak!

Det socialdemokraterne og de konservative kalder udvikling er reelt velf√¶rdsm√¶ssig afvikling. Og alle √∏konomer ved det!",Other,"the energy island bornholm project is a financial nightmare for both the people of bornholm and danish taxpayers at large. here‚Äôs why: 

1. the minister of energy has already abandoned one project due to poor economics.  
2. even some of the strongest advocates for wind energy are calling this an economic disaster.  
3. professor brian vad argues that the entire setup is fundamentally flawed.  
4. the high cost is partly because the necessary technology hasn‚Äôt even been invented yet.  
5. government advisors have declared the project economically unsustainable.  

why are businesses still so vocal? their primary goal is profit. if the state pours taxpayer money into this foolish project, there‚Äôs a chance some funds might trickle down to bornholm‚Äôs businesses. but will that truly save bornholm? no. reports show the island‚Äôs economy could benefit more from addressing 20 fewer costly legal cases than from this so-called energy adventure.

2050,1/13/2025 11:52:18,"K√¶re Claus Larsen-Jensen fra Socialdemokratiet
Vi har l√¶st dit svar til Helles debatindl√¶g om, at der er behov for et energipolitisk sporskifte, og at det er p√• tide, at vi ogs√• p√• Bornholm handler nu og her i stedet for at vente p√•, at alt vil l√∏se sig med energi√∏ens komme. üå±
2024 har tydeligt vist, at de visioner, som energi- og forsyningssektoren med klimapartnerskabet tegnede op tilbage i 2020 ‚Äì med brintindustrien som et centralt omdrejningspunkt ‚Äì i bedste fald ligger langt ude i fremtiden. Dette stiller ogs√• planerne om Energi√∏ Bornholm i en meget vanskelig situation.
Men i stedet for at forholde dig til de reelle udfordringer, v√¶lger du at l√¶se indl√¶gget, som fanden l√¶ser biblen. Du p√•st√•r, at vi systematisk er imod Energi√∏ Bornholm, Erhvervsparken og PtX.
‚úîÔ∏è Ja, vi er kritiske, n√•r store virksomheder lover os guld og gr√∏nne skove.
‚úîÔ∏è Ja, vi er skeptiske over for upr√∏vede teknologier.
‚úîÔ∏è Og ja, vi er forsigtige med at omfavne planer, der kan f√• vidtr√¶kkende konsekvenser for Bornholm, vores samfund og vores natur.
‚òùÔ∏èMen hos Enhedslisten Bornholm er vi ikke per automatik imod Energi√∏ Bornholm. Da projektet f√∏rst blev lanceret, var forventningen, at det ville gavne forsyningssikkerheden og v√¶re en fornuftig samfunds√∏konomisk investering. Derfor var vi ogs√• positive over for projektet.
I takt med at fakta er kommet p√• bordet, har dette billede imidlertid √¶ndret sig ‚Äì b√•de p√• nationalt og lokalt niveau ‚Äì og det tager vi naturligvis bestik af. Derfor er vi ogs√• langt mere forbeholdne over for projektet i dag.
For skal man ud at bruge op til 17,6 milliarder kroner i statsst√∏tte, s√• skal vi virkelig v√¶re sikre p√•, at der er tale om en investering, som sikrer mest mulig gr√∏n omstilling for pengene. Og set fra det bornholmske perspektiv, s√• skulle det da ogs√• helst v√¶re s√•dan, at fordelene klart opvejede ulemperne.
Hvis de hidtidige fors√∏g med PtX-teknologier havde givet positive resultater, der dokumenterede, at teknologien b√•de kunne v√¶re rentabel og energieffektiv ‚Äì ogs√• p√• Bornholm ‚Äì ville vi ogs√• v√¶re mere √•bne over for denne del af planerne.
Men sagen er imidlertid ‚Äì og det er det, rigtig mange begivenheder i 2024 har vist ‚Äì at mange af disse forh√•bninger og forventninger har vist sig at v√¶re et godt stykke fra virkeligheden.
üí° Det er vi n√∏dt til at se i √∏jnene, ikke mindst som den √∏konomisk pressede og udfordrede kommune, vi er.
Vi skal bruge borgernes penge p√• energi- og erhvervspolitiske tiltag, der skaber en positiv forandring ‚Äì ikke bare for klima og natur, men ogs√• for de bornholmske borgere og virksomheder.
Et passende sted at starte ville v√¶re at genoptage arbejdet med at implementere den Energistrategi for Bornholm, som en enig kommunalbestyrelse vedtog i 2021.
En strategi, som prioriterer:
üåø Udfasningen af fossile og andre klimabelastende energikilder.
üåû Etablering af lokal vedvarende energiproduktion prim√¶rt til det bornholmske marked.",Other,"we at enhedslisten bornholm do not oppose the energy island bornholm project outright. when the project was first introduced, it seemed like a promising way to enhance energy security and provide a sound socio-economic investment. however, as more facts have come to light, both nationally and locally, we have become much more cautious.  

i am skeptical of unproven technologies like power-to-x (ptx) and cautious about the lofty promises made by large corporations that often fail to materialize. the challenges with ptx, as demonstrated throughout 2024, have shown that the technology has not yet proven to be energy-efficient or economically viable, especially here on bornholm.  

if the government plans to spend up to 17.6 billion kroner in state support, we must ensure that this investment guarantees the maximum possible green transition for the money spent. from where i stand, any such investment must also provide clear benefits that outweigh the potential downsides for bornholm‚Äôs community, environment, and economy.  

as a financially challenged municipality, we need to focus on energy and industrial policies that deliver tangible benefits for our residents and businesses. rather than relying on uncertain outcomes, i believe we should return to the 2021 energy strategy for bornholm. this strategy prioritizes phasing out fossil fuels, establishing local renewable energy production, and ensuring these efforts primarily serve bornholm‚Äôs market.

Lars Tvede's concerns about the current energy transition are as follows:

1. We are not transitioning to renewable energy. Globally, renewable energy has not gained market share in the last 20 years, despite a 40% increase in energy consumption. In Denmark, wind and solar provide only about 1/10 of the energy, with the rest coming from burning coal, oil, gas, biomass, and waste. The planned energy island, now canceled, would have only increased wind's share to 14%.

2. Solar, wind, and electric cars are not truly renewable. They have a lifespan of about 20 years, after which they must be scrapped, generating large amounts of waste. For example, Denmark will scrap 66,000 tons of old wind turbine blades in 2023-25.

3. We do not have enough space and metal for a renewable world. Offshore wind energy requires 15 times more industrial metal than gas power plants, and solar energy requires 7 times more. Electric cars need 4-7 times more metal than traditional cars. Mining investments have not increased as needed, and it takes about 15 years to open a new copper mine.

4. Renewable energy is not green. Biomass would require 3.6 times Denmark's area, wind turbines would cover all of Jutland, and solar panels would cover half of Zealand. Fossil fuels are actually greener in some ways, as CO2 promotes plant growth and increases rainfall.

5. We need other forms of energy. Renewable energy may never exceed 15% of global supply. Nuclear power, including SMRs, thorium, and fusion, as well as technologies like CCUS and geothermal, are more promising. Innovation tends to move towards more compact solutions, and nuclear energy is the most compact and greenest form of energy.

Overall, Tvede believes that the current focus on renewable energy is misguided and that nuclear power and other technologies offer better solutions for the future.
```",Other,"lars tvede's concerns about the current energy transition are as follows:

1. we are not transitioning to renewable energy. globally, renewable energy has not gained market share in the last 20 years, despite a 40% increase in energy consumption. in denmark, wind and solar provide only about 1/10 of the energy, with the rest coming from burning coal, oil, gas, biomass, and waste. the planned energy island, now canceled, would have only increased wind's share to 14%.

2. solar, wind, and electric cars are not truly renewable. they have a lifespan of about 20 years, after which they must be scrapped, generating large amounts of waste. for example, denmark will scrap 66,000 tons of old wind turbine blades in 2023-25.

3. we do not have enough space and metal for a renewable world. offshore wind energy requires 15 times more industrial metal than gas power plants, and solar energy requires 7 times more. electric cars need 4-7 times more metal than traditional cars. mining investments have not increased as needed, and it takes about 15 years to open a new copper mine.

4. renewable energy is not green. biomass would require 3.6 times denmark's area, wind turbines would cover all of jutland, and solar panels would cover half of zealand. fossil fuels are actually greener in some ways, as co2 promotes plant growth and increases rainfall.

5. we need other forms of energy. renewable energy may never exceed 15% of global supply. nuclear power, including smrs, thorium, and fusion, as well as technologies like ccus and geothermal, are more promising. innovation tends to move towards more compact solutions, and nuclear energy is the most compact and greenest form of energy.

Noget andet for os, der bor p√• Bornholm er konsekvenserne for det bornholmske samfund. Svaret er egentlig ret enkelt. Bornholm f√•r intet ud af det, men risikerer at st√•r med k√¶mpe ekstraudgifter. Efter svarene for nylig fra Energinet og Trefor √∏st omkring Energi√∏en og evt. sammenkobling mellem energi√∏en og det bornholmske elnet rejser der sig en lang r√¶kke sp√∏rgsm√•l, som der ikke svares p√• i svarene fra Energinet og Trefor √∏st..
Og det store sp√∏rgsm√•l er naturligvis, hvad bornholmerne f√•r ud af det. Energinet siger vi f√•r mere forsyningssikkerhed end med s√∏kablet. Det g√¶lder s√• kun til den dag Putin smadrer energi√∏en med et par bomber. S√• har Bornholm ligesom et mindre problem, fordi vi ikke har str√∏m.

For BEOF og ikke mindst Trefor √òst vil en sammenkobling betyde store ekstraudgifter. Hvad BEOF skal bidrage med ved vel kun BEOF selv. Men det bliver ikke en gratis omgang.
Den store ekstraregning tilfalder Trefor √òst og dermed os forbrugere, som reglerne er i dag. Meget bekvemt undlader b√•de Energinet og Trefor √∏st at s√¶tte estimerede bel√∏b p√• sammenkoblingen.

and the big question, naturally, is what bornholmers will get out of it. energinet claims that we will have greater energy security than with the current submarine cable. that will only hold true until the day putin destroys the energy island with a couple of bombs. then bornholm will have a significant problem because we will have no power.

energinet also says we will have more stable electricity prices. prices are fairly stable as things stand, and that situation won't change with the energy island and its connection to the local grid. nor will we get cheaper electricity. all experts agree that electricity prices on bornholm will remain roughly the same as today. bornholm will become its own bidding zone, but supply and demand will determine the price, meaning electricity prices will stay unchanged.

for beof and especially trefor √∏st, such a connection will mean substantial additional expenses. only beof knows how much they will have to contribute, but it won't be a free pass. the major additional costs will fall on trefor √∏st, and therefore on us consumers, under current regulations. conveniently, neither energinet nor trefor √∏st provides estimated figures for the connection. but it's likely the amounts are so large that they would alarm any ordinary bornholm citizen. we are already struggling with denmark's highest electricity prices, thanks to trefor √∏st's actions on bornholm. so mentioning the cost of connecting the energy island to the local grid is probably not a smart strategy.

Vi har l√¶st dit svar til Helles debatindl√¶g om, at der er behov for et energipolitisk sporskifte, og at det er p√• tide, at vi ogs√• p√• Bornholm handler nu og her i stedet for at vente p√•, at alt vil l√∏se sig med energi√∏ens komme. üå± 
2024 har tydeligt vist, at de visioner, som energi- og forsyningssektoren med klimapartnerskabet tegnede op tilbage i 2020 ‚Äì med brintindustrien som et centralt omdrejningspunkt ‚Äì i bedste fald ligger langt ude i fremtiden. Dette stiller ogs√• planerne om Energi√∏ Bornholm i en meget vanskelig situation. 
Men i stedet for at forholde dig til de reelle udfordringer, v√¶lger du at l√¶se indl√¶gget, som fanden l√¶ser biblen. Du p√•st√•r, at vi systematisk er imod Energi√∏ Bornholm, Erhvervsparken og PtX. 
‚úîÔ∏èJa, vi er kritiske, n√•r store virksomheder lover os guld og gr√∏nne skove. 
‚úîÔ∏èJa, vi er skeptiske over for upr√∏vede teknologier. 
‚úîÔ∏èOg ja, vi er forsigtige med at omfavne planer, der kan f√• vidtr√¶kkende konsekvenser for Bornholm, vores samfund og vores natur. 
‚òùÔ∏èMen hos Enhedslisten Bornholm er vi ikke per automatik imod Energi√∏ Bornholm. Da projektet f√∏rst blev lanceret, var forventningen, at det ville gavne forsyningssikkerheden og v√¶re en fornuftig samfunds√∏konomisk investering. Derfor var vi ogs√• positive over for projektet. 
I takt med at fakta er kommet p√• bordet, har dette billede imidlertid √¶ndret sig ‚Äì b√•de p√• nationalt og lokalt niveau ‚Äì og det tager vi naturligvis bestik af. Derfor er vi ogs√• langt mere forbeholdne over for projektet i dag. 
For skal man ud at bruge op til 17,6 milliarder kroner i statsst√∏tte, s√• skal vi virkelig v√¶re sikre p√•, at der er tale om en investering, som sikrer mest mulig gr√∏n omstilling for pengene. Og set fra det bornholmske perspektiv, s√• skulle det da ogs√• helst v√¶re s√•dan, at fordelene klart opvejede ulemperne. 
Hvis de hidtidige fors√∏g med PtX-teknologier havde givet positive resultater, der dokumenterede, at teknologien b√•de kunne v√¶re rentabel og energieffektiv ‚Äì ogs√• p√• Bornholm ‚Äì ville vi ogs√• v√¶re mere √•bne over for denne del af planerne. 
Men sagen er imidlertid ‚Äì og det er det, rigtig mange begivenheder i 2024 har vist ‚Äì at mange af disse forh√•bninger og forventninger har vist sig at v√¶re et godt stykke fra virkeligheden. 
üí°Det er vi n√∏dt til at se i √∏jnene, ikke mindst som den √∏konomisk pressede og udfordrede kommune, vi er. 
Vi skal bruge borgernes penge p√• energi- og erhvervspolitiske tiltag, der skaber en positiv forandring ‚Äì ikke bare for klima og natur, men ogs√• for de bornholmske borgere og virksomheder. 
Et passende sted at starte ville v√¶re at genoptage arbejdet med at implementere den Energistrategi for Bornholm, som en enig kommunalbestyrelse vedtog i 2021.

üåøUdfasningen af fossile og andre klimabelastende energikilder.

we are critical of big companies making lofty promises, skeptical of untested technologies like power-to-x (ptx), and cautious about plans that could have far-reaching consequences for bornholm‚Äôs community and environment.

As for the PV panels; We do not have sufficient land area for them, that are constructed how? Using heat energy generated how? to build these infrastructures? turbines, PV panels etc...?, we do not have enough daylight and storage facilities to keep the power going through the night or overcast days, we do not have enough wind and yet we have put those ugly turbines in one of the calmest areas of Mahe, Victoria Harbor. Why not put it on top of the ridge of the Mahe where any reversal of wind direction wont affect the turbines? Remember, we got those wind turbines as ""donations"" from one of the world's leading petroleum country, UAE. Great initiative though, shows us how we can invest and get our own renewables going in the future when we have realized the best set up for our location. We try to live the same narratives as those ""world leading ""countries, only because it is at a fashionable stage. I believe in renewables, and I wish it all works in the future. They have already trapped us in the carbon tunnel vision. I support renewables, I don't want to destroy the best part of my country, so I support solar energy and wind energy, they are clean, but I am also realistic... and right now, building and maintaining them is at a higher environmental cost. So if we want to carry on with the reclamations, then we welcome you to the ""Mud archipelago of the Indian Ocean, Seychelles"".....",Facebook user,"the facebook-user states: ""while i support renewable energy like solar and wind power for their clean and sustainable benefits, i have significant concerns about the current approach to implementing these solutions in seychelles. the reclaimed islands, which are being used for such projects, cause severe destruction to the marine environment, far exceeding the impact of a well-drilled for oil. this reclamation is a leading driver of environmental change in seychelles. 

seychelles does not contribute to anthropogenic effects at the same level as developed countries because we do not overconsume or overproduce. yet, large-scale overfishing, which is still allowed, is a more pressing issue, causing destruction to the marine food chain and increasing bycatch. additionally, the infrastructure for solar panels and wind turbines comes with its own environmental costs. these structures require heat energy for production, which often relies on fossil fuels. seychelles lacks sufficient land area for solar panels, and the available daylight and energy storage facilities are inadequate to ensure consistent power supply during the night or overcast days. 

the placement of wind turbines in victoria harbor, one of the calmest areas of mah√©, is poorly thought out. a better location would be along the ridge of mah√©, where wind reversals would have minimal impact. it‚Äôs worth noting that these turbines were donated by the uae, a leading petroleum country. while this initiative highlights the potential for seychelles to invest in its own renewables in the future, it also demonstrates that we are emulating the approaches of developed countries largely because it is currently fashionable.

renewables are essential for the future, but right now, building and maintaining them in seychelles carries a high environmental cost. if reclamation continues at this rate, we risk turning seychelles into the 'mud archipelago of the indian ocean.' i hope that in the future, we will develop renewable solutions that are better suited to our unique location and environmental needs.""",9/5/2022,https://www.facebook.com/groups/240452330668920/posts/832563351457812/,Facebook,Social media,2022,2240.156006,-261.426178,Marine life and evironmental impact of constructing energy islands,True,Neither

4269,1/13/2025 13:23:35,"France was the largest electricity supplier in 2024 with a net of 13 TWh. Reason is lower costs. ""Electricity is generated in the European Union where it is the cheapest possible"", emphasizes the Federal Net Agency. Germany has sufficient production capacity, but if domestic production is more expensive, electricity is imported. So you can say: the rest of the German power plant has fallen in competitiveness since the nuclear rise.
This situation would not be so polically urgent, if French electricity would not be about 70 percent of nuclear origin. Germany is strictly not out of nuclear energy, but continues to use it indirectly. By doing so, it is unwittingly admitting that existing reactors are a weather-available, low-CO2 and above all an inexpensive source of production - cheaper than coal and gas power plants, where besides fuel, the increasingly expensive certificates in European CO2 trade are included in the calculation.
The more than 50 French reactors play their advantages, especially in phases without electricity from wind and solar systems, the dark floods. Then the nuclear production costs are practically unrivaled. The French Energy Regulatory Authority CRE rates this as an average of around six cents per kilowatt-hour for the medium term.
This bill includes all costs of modernization, disposal of nuclear materials and waste, and recycling. The same applies to the construction costs of the Flamanville 3 reactor, which was just completed with a great delay, although the French Court of Auditors estimates its production costs to be far above average up to twelve cents.
The net operating costs of the French reactors should be only three to four cents, says Nicolas Goldberg, consultant at the Paris Institute Columbus Consulting. That's less than half of what electricity cost in German wholesale in 2024.
Export is therefore lucrative for France‚Äôs power plant operator EDF, especially since the demand for electricity in the country persists at a low level because of the weak economic situation. In 2023 EDF generated a record profit of a net of ten billion euros. Another billion surplus is expected for 2024 - even though EDF has to sell 100 TWh annually at a special price of 4.2 cents to French industry.",Facebook user,"france has become germany's largest electricity supplier in 2024, providing a net 13 twh, due to france's lower production costs. while germany has enough production capacity, german power plants have lost competitiveness since the nuclear phaseout. the european union's electricity market operates on a lowest-cost principle, as confirmed by the federal net agency - electricity is generated wherever it's cheapest.

this situation is politically sensitive because about 70% of french electricity comes from nuclear power. germany hasn't truly abandoned nuclear energy - germany is still using nuclear power indirectly through imports. this effectively acknowledges that existing nuclear reactors are weather-independent, low-co2, and most importantly, an inexpensive power source - cheaper than coal and gas plants which face additional costs from increasingly expensive eu co2 certificates.

france's 50+ nuclear reactors demonstrate their economic advantage especially during periods without wind and solar power (dark doldrums). during these times, nuclear production costs are unmatched. the french energy regulatory authority cre estimates medium-term costs at around six cents per kilowatt-hour, including all modernization costs, nuclear material disposal, waste management, and recycling. even factoring in the expensive flamanville 3 reactor's high production costs of up to twelve cents, as estimated by the french court of auditors, nuclear remains competitive.

the operational costs for french reactors are only three to four cents according to nicolas goldberg from columbus consulting paris - less than half of germany's 2024 wholesale electricity prices. this makes exports highly profitable for edf, france's power plant operator, especially with france's current low domestic demand due to economic weakness. edf achieved record profits of 10 billion euros net in 2023, with another billion expected in 2024, despite being required to sell 100 twh annually to french industry at a special rate of 4.2 cents.",1/10/2025,https://www.facebook.com/groups/335346330712395/posts/1665748231005525/?_rdr,Facebook,Social media,2025,639.900635,1281.795044,Is nuclear power an alternative to energy islands?,True,neither

""London, 10 June ‚Äî The Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) is today publishing a collection of papers by energy expert Dr John Constable, documenting the rapid decay of the UK electricity system, with system balancing costs spiraling out of control over the last few weeks.
The cost of balancing the grid over the Bank Holiday weekend amounted to ¬£50m, and National Grid has predicted additional costs of ¬£700m from May to August alone. It has taken desperate measures in an attempt to reduce the bill, but according to expert observers, these may well prove futile.
GB system balancing costs have been rising sharply over recent decades, as inflexible renewables have taken a leading role in electricity supply, driven by ¬£10 billion a year of subsidies and price-fixing arrangements. In 2002 system balancing cost ¬£367m, but by 2019 it had risen to just under ¬£1.5bn, a level that was expected to be sustained this year.
However, because wind and solar can‚Äôt respond to the low demand caused by lockdown, National Grid now expects the total to be about ¬£2bn, and even that figure is based on the optimistic assumption that costs return to normal after August.
If the lockdown runs on into the autumn, the cost could easily rise by hundreds of millions more, and a prolonged post-Covid recession could mean consumers having to foot this bill for many years to come.
Dr Constable, author of the GWPF study, said:
‚ÄúRenewables have been undermining the UK electricity system for years, with National Grid propping up a tottering system with vast piles of consumer cash. The Covid-19 lockdown has caused a balancing cost surge and revealed this green appeasement policy as unsustainable. The UK‚Äôs fragile renewables-based system can barely deal with the expected; a surprise causes a crisis.‚Äù
Dr Constable added:
‚ÄúIf demand remains low during the post-Covid recession the multi-billion pound costs of managing and subsidising renewables must be recovered from a much smaller volume of sales. That is a recipe for rapid and abrupt price rises, the like of which the British public have never seen. Enough is enough. In what everyone agrees is a very difficult moment the national interest demands a cost minimisation strategy for electricity, based on gas and nuclear.‚Äù",Other,"the uk electricity system is rapidly deteriorating because of renewable energy sources, as proven by the skyrocketing system balancing costs in recent weeks. the bank holiday weekend alone required ¬£50 million in balancing costs, and national grid projects an additional ¬£700 million in costs from may to august. grid balancing costs have risen dramatically as subsidized, inflexible renewables have taken over electricity supply - from ¬£367 million in 2002 to nearly ¬£1.5 billion in 2019. now, due to wind and solar's inability to respond to low demand during lockdown, national grid expects costs to reach ¬£2 billion, and this estimate assumes costs normalize after august.

the uk's renewable-based system is fragile and can barely handle normal operations - any unexpected situation causes a crisis. national grid has been propping up this failing system with enormous amounts of consumer money. with ¬£10 billion per year in subsidies and price-fixing for renewables, consumers are paying astronomical costs for an unreliable system. if demand stays low during a post-covid recession, these multi-billion pound costs for managing and subsidizing renewables will need to be recovered from much smaller electricity sales volumes, leading to unprecedented price increases for british consumers.

the national interest demands a cost minimization strategy based on gas and nuclear power. consumers should start saving money now because they will need diesel generators to maintain reliable power supply. the uk government cannot be trusted to spend public money wisely on energy. the 'zerowits' who fell for this green fraud should be ashamed of putting so much at risk and wasting public money. renewable energy has caused extensive damage at enormous cost with no benefit to consumers or the environment.",6/10/2020,https://www.facebook.com/WindEnergysAbsurd/posts/the-brink-of-darkness-britains-fragile-power-gridby-dr-john-constablewe-dont-nee/3259859674058452/,Facebook,Social media,2020,1645.324829,1423.354492,Is nuclear power an alternative to energy islands?,True,Negative

4449,1/13/2025 12:11:35,"Nick Winser is the UK Electricity Networks Commissioner appointed by Kwarteng in July 2022 to, inter alia, 'accelerate the delivery of crucial electricity network infrastructure'. Nick Winser is also the Chair of Energy Systems Catapult, in Birmingham, which was incorporated in 2013 and, according to its website, was established to ' accelerate the transformation of the UK‚Äôs energy system and ensure UK businesses and consumers capture the opportunities of clean growth on the way to Net Zero.'

The mission of Catapult is to 'to unleash innovation and open new markets to capture the clean growth opportunity'.

Nick Winser's role was, according to Kwasi Kwarteng (now replaced by Grant Shapps) to help make sure that 'infrastructure, such as electricity poles and transmission lines, are in the right places so clean, British-generated electricity can flow to households across the country.' And this part of his remit is the one which has led to the report:

'This includes dramatically reducing timelines for delivering onshore transmission network infrastructure by around 3 years and developing recommendations to help halve the end-to-end project process by the mid-2020s.' (In fact, Winser has reduced the time scale to by around 7 years.)

Some of the main areas have been highlighted in the press, most notably that which gives the MSM its best headlines - '(i) Lump sum payments for individual households close to new lines. (ii) A community fund to be established and distributed in the locality of new lines.'

The report and the resume are basically, in our view, stating that the whole system is piecemeal and needs to be thoroughly overhauled and it makes concrete recommendations. There are some areas where we feel it was politely very critical and we also feel that this is reflected in parts of Shapps' response, where he lists what the government is doing, and says this: 'We will give your recommendations full consideration in the Action Plan but I can be clear now that the direction of the package is broadly in line with the approach being taken by Government. As described above, we are already taking steps to accelerate delivery through strategic planning of the network and faster consenting and regulatory approval.'

We are reminded here of the government response to the excellent Cost of Energy Review which Dieter Helm produced in record time in 2017, which was fundamentally ignored.

'Recommendation 11 - Implement reforms to the Electricity Act 1989 consenting process in Scotland There are a series of reforms in the attached ESC paper aimed at aligning the consenting system used in Scotland under the 1989 Electricity Act and the Planning Act of 2008. The intention of these reforms is to broadly align the processes used under these two pieces of legislation by introducing a preapplication consultation, defined timescales for the different stages and clearer responsibilities for each party involved into the operation of the Electricity Act in Scotland. These reforms are vital. The very significant amount of wind generation in Scotland needs substantially better transmission infrastructure to be developed quickly

Furthermore, alignment between the processes in Scotland and England and Wales will assist the significant task of reinforcing the system across the Scottish border.'

Then comes what has very recently, following certain politician calls, been the cause of consternation that democracy is at risk.

'We also recommend that the trigger for mandatory public local inquiry is removed from the planning authority so that only a Scottish minister can trigger one based on all responses from statutory consultees. This amendment to The Electricity Act of 1989 should be progressed as a matter of urgency, possibly through the current Energy Bill passing through Parliament. This is required to support 2030 projects required to meet energy targets.'

In 5.8 of the report - Planning Process Scotland - proposed changes are discussed in more detail, with this sentence included: 'This change is required to support projects currently in flight and those about to go through planning approval in Scotland, which are critical national infrastructure required to meet 2030 renewable energy targets. ' In flight???

There is a lot more in the report, including fairly detailed recommendations for a publicity campaign on the basis that the public does not understand the need.

Well, that's not surprising, given this, in the summary:

'We don‚Äôt have a settled, strategic, efficient and timely process for identifying need for new transmission assets. The regulatory process has evolved from considering individual transmission lines to groups of them, but it is not settled, streamlined, regular and operating at a system level.

The Energy National Policy Statements(NPS) are badly out of date and offer little guidance as to national engineering and environment priorities and trade-offs. There is no long-term spatial plan to demonstrate the position and need for a new line within the integrated system. There is no agreed and public guidance as to how, where, and why lines should be onshore or offshore, overhead or underground, lattice pylons or novel designs. There is no agreed and public guidance on how system design should balance different environmental benefits and costs and how to trade-off global, national, regional and local impacts. Is it so surprising that such alarm, emotion and controversy is aroused by the schemes?'

SSEN have jumped this gun, we think, and their actions, described by us in the reprise of our earlier post as 'hobnail booting' have led to gathering major unrest and, of course, the calls by CB4PC for 'evidence of need' which have not been answered.",Other,"we at wind energy's absurd believe that nick winser‚Äôs report exposes a disorganized and fragmented approach to energy infrastructure planning in the uk. we see no settled, strategic, or efficient process for identifying the need for new transmission lines, and the current regulatory system is outdated and ineffective.  

we observe that the energy national policy statements are obsolete, failing to provide guidance on national priorities or how to balance engineering, environmental, and local considerations. in our view, the lack of transparency and public understanding fuels unnecessary alarm and controversy over these projects.  

we strongly oppose proposals like removing mandatory public inquiries in scotland, which we see as a direct threat to democratic processes. we also believe that the government‚Äôs response to this report, much like its neglect of dieter helm‚Äôs 2017 cost of energy review, shows a pattern of ignoring critical recommendations. without significant reform, including better coordination and faster consenting processes, we think it will be impossible to achieve renewable energy targets by 2030.""",8/4/2023,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=661983425958961&id=100064419293322&set=a.455525843271388,Facebook,Social media,2023,-155.170502,469.777435,Bureaucracy and regulation,True,negative

4453,1/13/2025 12:19:30,"The stated purpose of the Kintore-Fiddes-Tealing transmission line in NE Scotland is to serve the offshore wind power industry. I have heard several reports recently suggesting that this industry is only marginally commercially viable. In March Orsted reported difficulty with their Hornsea 3 wind farm off the coast of Norfolk, and implied that they wanted more tax breaks (subsidy) from the government. In July the Swedish wind giant Vattenfall expressed a similar view, that without further ""consideration"" they would abandon the Boreas wind farm. Two other WFs of theirs in the same area, Vanguard East and West, all off Norfolk, are under serious consideration by Vattenfall.
Other reasons given include supply-chain delays and price hikes, difficulty getting affordable capital, etc. Both these firms are already effectively subsidised under the Contract-for-Difference scheme. I remember commenting to the Save-Our-Mearns group, that subsidy was traditionally used to help fledgling companies get on their feet. It is thus difficult to understand how the current UK offshore wind industry can possibly be referred to as fledgling. Yet the CfD scheme continues! They claim that the strike price, set up in 2012, but index-linked to inflation, is now out of step with current energy prices, which are far higher. The CfD was set in 2012 at ¬£37 per MWhr (wholesale), which corresponds to ¬£45 per MWhr today, whilst the current wholesale price of energy is around ¬£130 per MWhr.
Given the government‚Äôs self-inflicted panic to reach Net-Zero, these companies might get what they want. Any government that bucks the collective wisdom and builds or re-opens fossil and/or nuclear instead, risks hostility from the faithful, in the form of trade sanctions, loss of defence agreements and cultural exchanges, etc. Conversely, if such big outfits like Orsted and Vattenfall feel the pinch, what of the smaller companies in UK offshore wind with less ability to juggle assets to overcome a dip in the market, or a cash flow or supply chain problem?
Many states of the world have for years been re-opening or new-building fossil and/or nuclear power stations in desperation, declaring non-compliance with Net-Zero, and accepting disapproval from the rest, because their populations are without electricity as its price is too high (renewables), starving or dying of preventable disease.
To my knowledge the UK has nine operating nuclear reactors, on six sites. These are/were to close in either 2016 or 2026, with the possible extensions at Hunterston C and Sizewell C yet to appear. Add to this the remaining fossil stations in England and Wales, and what gas stations remain in Scotland ‚Äì until the Greens force closure on these. Existing and planned battery backup is apparently pathetically inadequate to go all-renewable, and very expensive. Hence we might have a serious shortage of electrical supply in three years‚Äô time.
The ‚Äúbeast from the east‚Äù winds of February 2018 should have given us a warning about this. Scotland‚Äôs wind turbines provided a lot of energy, but gas was in short supply as there was little onshore storage. Centrica‚Äôs ‚ÄúRough‚Äù north-sea gas storage had been abandoned after damage that was not economic to repair, and there was a problem with the gas pipe from Norway. A lot of our energy came from England and Wales with their fossil and nuclear stations running flat out. If the wind had dropped we could have had eight days of national blackout in Scotland. Centrica has re-opened the Rough north-sea gas storage and now claims that it will hold enough to last six days of average demand, or 3.5 days in winter. See link below. Just hope that winter calm days do not exceed 3.5.
If the government were able to recognise the evidence and resist this bullying, then the north-sea bubble might just burst, with a return to common sense. There is still controversy over the Beauly-Denny line, eight years after its coming into service, with many seeing it as a white elephant, as most of the anticipated load went offshore.",Facebook user,"i believe the kintore-fiddes-tealing transmission line in northeast scotland was intended to support offshore wind power, but the industry is only marginally viable. recent reports from orsted and vattenfall highlight difficulties, despite receiving subsidies under the contract-for-difference scheme, which is now outdated given current energy prices.  

i see that the government‚Äôs obsession with reaching net zero at all costs could strain the industry further. many countries are already turning back to fossil fuels or nuclear power to ensure energy security, while the uk faces a looming energy crisis with diminishing nuclear and fossil fuel capacity, inadequate battery storage, and reliance on imported energy.

These are to be floated out to sea and sunk to become the foundations of a giant Belgian green energy development ‚Äî a world first ‚Äî which is itself, however, in choppy waters amid surging costs.

Named after Belgium‚Äôs Princess Elisabeth, the ‚Äúenergy island‚Äù was launched in 2021 to support a huge expansion in wind energy production that would drastically reduce the country‚Äôs dependence on planet-warming fossil fuels.

But supply chain snags have made costs more than triple to more than seven billion euros ($7.56 billion), according to some estimates, sparking calls for construction to be stopped at a time of growing political pushback against ambitious green targets across Europe.

Just over 10 percent of Belgium‚Äôs energy supply comes from renewable sources, the government says. Nuclear, gas and oil provide the bulk of its needs, according to the International Energy Agency.

Building an artificial island is what Belgian grid operator Elia believes is the most efficient way of bringing that energy to shore.

Located 45 kilometres (28 miles) off the coast, the island will host transformers and bundle together undersea cables to bring electricity to land.

It will also connect the Belgian grid with wind-power-producing North Sea neighbours, such as Britain and Denmark, allowing for a more stable energy supply.

The island is like ‚Äúan extension cord with multiple sockets‚Äù, said Joannes Laveyne, a researcher at Ghent University.

Proponents say placing it at sea avoids Nimbyism ‚Äî ‚Äúnot in my backyard‚Äù ‚Äî complaints from locals in a densely populated nation, and shortens international connections. Proximity to wind farms reduces energy losses.

The project won the blessing of environmental groups appeased by its green purpose and nature-friendly design. The island will have ledges for seabirds to breed and an artificial reef to boost marine life.

But Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine in 2022 threw a spanner in the works.

Suk.",Facebook user,"i hope these funds will create genuine jobs, but i have my doubts. i really wish the bornholm energy island project would also push for decentralization, so that some of this funding could help many more households on bornholm become self-sufficient in electricity. right now, organizations like baltic energy island seem determined to centralize power production, and i believe that is the wrong approach.

by decentralizing electricity production and building a smarter, denser network of smaller batteries, we could reduce the need for further expansion of the existing distribution grid on the island and also lessen dependence on the submarine cable. bornholm already has several households with battery systems, and many electric cars on the island support vehicle-to-grid (v2g) and vehicle-to-home (v2h) technology. with an intelligent system to manage them, we could make investing in batteries and electric vehicles more profitable. instead, the project spends all resources on centralizing production and channels them into large corporations‚Äô pockets. sigh.",9/22/2024,https://www.facebook.com/groups/3387083998202587/posts/3786490278261955/?_rdr,Facebook,Social media,2024,-3062.812012,-1078.456299,Who benefits socially and economically from energy islands?

Innovative plan in collaboration with Germany and the Netherlands could provide energy to 80 million Europeans.

Denmark has teamed up with Germany and the Netherlands to look into the possibility of building an island in the North Sea to locate wind turbines in the future.

The artificial island, which will include a harbour and a landing strip for aircraft, is proposed to be six square kilometres in size and be located on Dogger Bank, a large sandbank in a shallow area about 100 km off the east coast of the UK.

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt let our fantasy gain the upper hand, although it may sound a little crazy and like something out of science fiction,‚Äù said Torben Glar Nielsen, the technical head of national energy provider Energinet.dk.

Millions could benefit.
The national energy transmission companies of the three nations involved will sign an agreement on March 23 that looks into the opportunities of the island.

M√•ske b√∏r I interessere jer for de mekanismer, der f√∏rer til den type mavelanding for et prestigeprojekt som Energi√ò Bornholm.
Denne embedskvinde hos Energinet siger offentligt fra overfor en syg kultur, hvor man ikke s√¶tter faglighed forud for urealistiske politiske ideer om energiforsyning. N√•r eksperter ikke t√∏r sige at noget ikke giver faglig mening, s√• g√•r det som det g√∏r i s√• mange store kuldsejlede offentlige projekter.
‚ÄúSkadefryd har en bitter eftersmag.
Trods de mange overskrifter kommer udfaldet af g√•rsdagens havvindudbud i Nords√∏en ikke bag p√• nogen. Energistyrelsen og Energinet har nemlig allerede afholdt flere markedsdialoger om havvind, brintinfrastruktur og den manglende sammenh√¶ng derimellem. Alle var advaret. Derfor f√∏les det heller ikke godt at f√• ret. Det f√∏les trist, frustrerende, skuffende, desillusionerende‚Ä¶
Trods rigtig ordentligt og kompetent kollegaskab har jeg valgt at fratr√¶de min stilling i Energinet, men igennem det seneste √•r har jeg observeret f√∏lgende ting om det politiske system, som sandsynligvis har medvirket til floppet i g√•r:
  Der mangler teknisk og kommerciel forst√•else.
  Der findes en grad af mistillid overfor private markedsakt√∏rer, som s√• skal testes i lokal kontekst, selvom fallerede havvindudbud i fx Storbritannien allerede har vist trov√¶rdigheden af markedets advarsler.
  Embedsv√¶rkets forpligtelse til at f√∏re mangelfulde politiske aftaler s√• godt og loyalt ud i livet som muligt skaber inerti og forhindrer logiske, proaktive kursrettelser - selvom mange siger ‚Äúhov, vi kan se hajer nede i vandet nu,‚Äù s√• g√•r systemet alligevel planken ud.

i resigned from energinet due to the following observations about the political system:

1. there is a lack of technical and commercial understanding.
2. there is distrust toward private market players, despite evidence from failed offshore wind tenders in the uk proving the market's warnings credible.

Tidligere kunne man genkende de ‚Äúfine‚Äù p√• deres materielle goder. Gudskelov er det i mindre grad s√•dan i dag, hvor mange ganske almindelige mennesker har r√•d til en ganske fornuftigt tilv√¶relse, rent materielt.

Derfor s√∏ger overklassen - de ‚Äúfine‚Äù efter andre m√•der at snobbe p√•.

Forfatter og psykolog Rob Henderson p√•peger hvordan det nu er luksusholdninger. Man p√•tager sig holdninger, som for dem med f√¶rre ressourcer end en selv, har en st√∏rre direkte negativ konsekvens end for en selv.

Eksempler p√• det kunne v√¶re:

- Krav om hurtigere gr√∏n omstilling for den enkelte. (Jo st√¶rkere √∏konomi, desto mindre konsekvens).

- omdisponering af penge fra velf√¶rden til det de synes er interessant. Det kunne v√¶re teater eller Energi√∏ (de har selv √∏konomi til private sundhedsforsikringer og ekstra hjemmehj√¶lp).

- Nedg√∏relsen af hele fag. Se bare p√• hvor h√•rdt det er at tale h√•ndv√¶rk- og omsorgsfag op. De sidste 30 √•r, har de ‚Äúfine‚Äù sparket de erhverv under gulvbr√¶dderne.

I Danmark ved vi at partier som:

Socialdemokraterne, De radikale, Konservative og Venstre sidder p√• v√¶lgerne med pengene. (2019)

Men da uddannelse i mange √•r ogs√• har v√¶ret brugt til at ‚Äòsnobbe‚Äô, s√• er det v√¶rd at kigge p√• de ogs√•. Og der ved vi at det i h√∏j grad er de samme partier som fordeler dem med de ‚Äúp√¶neste‚Äù uddannelser.

Og n√•r man kigger p√• reges√• giver psykologens tese s√• fin mening. Ganske vist er Moderaterne kommet til, men de lukrere s√• p√• de fire andre partier.

Man kunne ogs√• kigge p√• identitetspolitikken, men det vanvid er mere rent venstreorienteret, og er mere ideologi.

Men overvej om du skal bruge lidt tid p√• ham psykologen, og hav det i baghovedet, n√•r den politiske debat buldrer derudaf.

De frelste er oftest dem med deres p√• det t√∏rre. Og b√•de i Danmark og p√• Bornholm er det dem, som har travlest med at bruge pengene p√• alt andet end kernevelf√¶rd.

when bornholm hosts such a large amount of renewable energy, it must also be used to drive development, create jobs, and provide educational opportunities. this is a model for how renewable energy can also generate local value creation, which is the goal for the entire country.  

last year, i participated in negotiating the climate and energy agreement, which included a dedicated section for bornholm outlining the framework for a business park because the energy island is the first of its kind. since then, i, along with many others, have worked to make it a reality. today‚Äôs funding from the rural development initiative plays a key role in this effort. it‚Äôs wonderful to feel that our hard work is making a difference.

5883,1/13/2025 12:46:26,"Mine konklusioner om Energi√∏ Bornholm

Det er et alvorligt demokratisk problem, at dele af dokumentationen for en s√• stor samfundsinvestering er m√∏rkelagt.

Der findes s√• godt som ingen offentligt tilg√¶ngelig information om de valgte tekniske l√∏sninger. Det afsk√¶rer teknisk interesserede fra at vurdere projektets tekniske risici.

Siden Energinets ‚ÄùBusiness case‚Äù fra 2022 er forventningen til projektets samfunds√∏konomi blevet kraftigt forringet. Derfor skal der tages stilling til, om projektet skal √¶ndres eller opgives.

Valget af en energi√∏ frem for en platformsl√∏sning medf√∏rer koncentration af store energioms√¶tninger i f√• punkter og dermed √∏get s√•rbarhed af elforsyningen i Danmark og i resten af Europa. I lyset af √∏gede internationale sp√¶ndinger b√∏r dette valg revurderes.

Den tekniske sammenkobling p√• energi√∏en betegnes i Energinets risikovurdering som ‚Äùumoden‚Äù. Det er mildt udtrykt, for sammenkoblingen er udfordrende, og indtil videre kun fors√∏gt fors√∏gt i fuld skala ganske f√• steder i verden.

Ingen danske virksomheder udvikler eller producerer HVDC-udstyr, s√• der er ingen dansk interesse i at satse p√• upr√∏vede l√∏sninger. Multiterminal offshore HVDC-l√∏sninger b√∏r ikke i nogen form indg√• i projektet, f√∏r de n√∏dvendige nye teknologier er fuldt afpr√∏vet andre steder.

Analyser af alternative l√∏sninger er fors√∏mt. P√• grund af d√•rlig √∏konomi og teknologisk usikkerhed b√∏r projektet stiles i bero, indtil alle relevante l√∏sninger er ordentligt unders√∏gt og vurderet.",Facebook user,"here are my conclusions about energy island bornholm:

it is a serious democratic problem that parts of the documentation for such a major societal investment are being kept secret.

there is virtually no publicly available information about the chosen technical solutions. this prevents technically interested citizens from assessing the project's technical risks.

since energinet's ""business case"" from 2022, expectations for the project's economic benefits to society have significantly deteriorated. therefore, a decision needs to be made whether to modify or abandon the project.

the choice of an energy island instead of a platform solution leads to concentrated energy conversions in few points, thereby increasing the vulnerability of electricity supply in denmark and the rest of europe. in light of increased international tensions, this choice should be reevaluated.

the technical interconnection on the energy island is described as ""immature"" in energinet's risk assessment. this is an understatement, as the interconnection is challenging and has only been attempted at full scale in very few places worldwide.

no danish companies develop or produce hvdc equipment, so denmark has no interest in betting on unproven solutions. multi-terminal offshore hvdc solutions should not be included in the project in any form until the necessary new technologies have been fully tested elsewhere.

analyses of alternative solutions have been neglected. due to poor economics and technological uncertainty, the project should be suspended until all relevant solutions have been properly investigated and evaluated.",1/8/2025,https://www.facebook.com/groups/klimarealisme.dk/posts/1759445747937610/?_rdr,Facebook,Social media,2025,-826.533325,-396.942902,Do we have the right assessment criteria to evaluate if energy islands are a good idea?,True,Negative

5890,1/13/2025 12:51:26,"Energi√∏, erhvervspark og andre eventyrsfort√¶llinger‚Ä¶ üôÑ
Den sidste uge er Bornholm g√•et rokoko over, at et flertal som t√¶ller undertegnede siger nej til at udpege en erhvervspark. Vil gerne pointere hvorfor jeg har stemt som jeg har:
Den principielle grund: 
- Vi mener at bornholmerne skal sp√∏rges aktivt om energi√∏en og de medf√∏lgende aspekter. Vi har for snart et halvt √•r siden proklameret at vi ville stemme nej indtil det er sket. 
De politiske grunde: 
1. Er kommunen skeptisk overfor parken, s√• er der st√∏rre chance for at energi√∏en forh√•bentlig f√•r d√∏dsst√∏det. Noget alle danske skatteydere b√∏r h√•be p√•!
2. Vi kommer ALDRIG til at tjene penge p√• PTX. Til den tid har kineserne over 13 √•rs reelt forspring. De dumper allerede priserne nu, hvilket g√∏r det sv√¶rere for vestligt orienterede producenter.  √òrsted tror ikke p√• det l√¶ngere, og konkurrencesituationen g√∏r det kun endnu mere umuligt at lave noget b√¶redygtigt. Vi skal fokusere p√• den industri vi er konkurrencedygtige i. 
3. Vi vil ikke g√∏re som Skive! Vi spurgte Skive kommune hvor mange de havde brugt p√• deres erhvervspark. Det var i omegnen af 30 mio. l√¶g dertil arbejdstimer, som ikke kan udvikle alt muligt andet. 
4. Vi vil have politik skal v√¶re √¶rligt. 
Der er ikke mange arbejdspladser, guld i kommunekassen eller m√¶lk og honning i gaderne, hvis energi√∏en og f√∏lgeerhverv kommer. Hvorfor bruger s√• mange politikere s√• meget tid p√• det s√•? Fordi det er nemmere at s√¶lge en dr√∏m end at holde √∏je p√• bolden. Folk forf√∏res af gode historier, og dr√∏mmen om en bedre tilv√¶relse. Bare se p√• religi√∏se bev√¶gelser, Bright green Island, diverse ideologier mv. 
Det er det samme her. Folks tilgang til det her er religi√∏st - desv√¶rre. 
Hvad vil DF s√•? Sk√¶re udgifterne til, og prioritere ALLE  mulige midler til det som vi ved virker. Sociale investeringer mhp. at √∏ge den sociale mobilitet og g√∏re folk mere selvhjulpne. 
Man m√• godt synes vi er kedelige og dumme, men hellere kedelig og dum, og s√• blive i den virkelige verden og h√•ndtere problemerne. Det er for nemt at tr√¶de ind i Narnia eller en anden fantasiverden, og s√• bilde folk ind at verdenen er  bedre end den i virkeligheden er.",Other,"energy island, business park, and other fairy tales

last week, bornholm went into a frenzy over the fact that a majority, including myself, voted against designating a business park. i would like to explain why i voted the way i did:

the principled reason:  
- we believe that the people of bornholm should be actively consulted about the energy island and its associated aspects. nearly six months ago, we announced that we would vote no until this consultation took place.

the political reasons:  
1. if the municipality is skeptical of the park, there is a greater chance that the energy island will hopefully get a fatal blow. this is something all danish taxpayers should hope for!  
2. we will never make money from power-to-x (ptx). by then, the chinese will have more than 13 years of real lead time. they are already lowering prices, which makes it harder for western-oriented producers. √∏rsted no longer believes in it, and the competitive situation makes it even more impossible to create something sustainable. we must focus on industries where we are competitive.  
3. we don't want to be like skive! we asked skive municipality how much they spent on their business park. it was around 30 million, plus work hours that could have been used for developing other things.  
4. we want politics to be honest.  

there won‚Äôt be many jobs, gold in the municipal coffers, or milk and honey in the streets if the energy island and its associated industries come to fruition. so why do so many politicians spend so much time on it? because it‚Äôs easier to sell a dream than to focus on the facts. people are lured by good stories and the dream of a better life. just look at religious movements, bright green island, and various ideologies.  

it‚Äôs the same here. people‚Äôs approach to this is religious‚Äîunfortunately.  

so, what does the danish people's party (df) want? cut spending and prioritize all available resources for what we know works‚Äîsocial investments aimed at increasing social mobility and making people more self-reliant.  

you can think we are boring and stupid, but i'd rather be boring and stupid and stay in the real world to address the problems. it‚Äôs too easy to step into narnia or another fantasy world and deceive people into thinking the world is better than it really is.",10/5/2024,https://www.facebook.com/story.php/?story_fbid=1098291978902319&id=100061645821989&_rdr,Facebook,Social media,2024,-2019.287964,-737.951599,Who benefits socially and economically from energy islands?

in addition to saving on maintenance and/or replacement costs for the subsea cable to sweden, energinet will save significant funds by decommissioning the backup power plant currently on standby. this is precisely why energinet will, over a relatively short period, actually save money by connecting the bornholm grid to the energy island project, which includes built-in connections to zealand, germany, and potentially poland.

Derfor er det faktisk en simpel l√∏gn, n√•r man itales√¶tter Energi√∏en, som noget der skal g√∏re Bornholm mere √∏konomisk b√¶redygtig. Det vil faktisk kr√¶ve over 14.000 tilflyttere med en gennemsnitsindkomst p√• 350.000 - cirka 64.000 mere end bornholmerne har i dag. Kigger vi p√• samme gennemsnitsindkomst, s√• er tallet over 17.000 tilflyttere!üò≥ü§Ø

Hvis befolkningen nogensinde skal have tilliden tilbage til politikerne, s√• kr√¶ver det at man t√∏r tro p√• det der bliver sagt. Og derfor nytter det ikke noget at lyve!

Bornholm bliver ALDRIG selvforsynende √∏konomisk. Vi er afh√¶ngige af udligning - desv√¶rre.

Til geng√¶ld er der rigtig meget √∏konomisk potentiale i at investere i bornholmerne. Potentialet i eksempelvis at h√∏jne trivslen blandt 10 procent folkeskoleeleverne kan estimeres til en √∏get kommunekasse-gevinst p√• minimum 83 mio. set udover et arbejdsliv. Dertil kan man s√• kigge p√• reducerede udgifter som konsekvens af den h√∏jnede trivsel.

Det er bornholmerne og deres velf√¶rd, som skal b√¶re os i fremtiden. Ikke fantasifulde projekter, som fjerner finansiering fra det vi ved virker.

Men til at starte med skal politikerne fort√¶lle virkeligheden som den er - og ikke som de √∏nsker den skulle se ud.

Hvad synes du?",Other,"may 2025 be the year of honesty! ü§ûüèª  

politicians have a tendency to sugarcoat things. that‚Äôs also the case on bornholm.  

we constantly hear social democrats, conservatives, and others claim that if energy island bornholm happens, everything will be great.  

they call it business policy and present the energy island as bornholm's great savior, which will free us from austerity measures and equalization payments.  

but is it really? üßêü§î  

bornholm receives 1.3 billion kroner in equalization payments and subsidies annually.  

even the most optimistic analyses suggest that the energy island would yield a return of around 60 million kroner by approximately 2036‚Äîand that‚Äôs if the ptx industry gets off the ground.  

therefore, it‚Äôs simply a lie to present the energy island as something that will make bornholm economically sustainable. for that to happen, we‚Äôd need over 14,000 new residents with an average income of 350,000 kroner‚Äîabout 64,000 more than the current average income on bornholm. if we stick to the current average income, the number rises to over 17,000 new residents! üò≥ü§Ø  

if people are ever to regain trust in politicians, it requires believing in what is being said. that means no more lies!  

bornholm will never be economically self-sufficient. we are dependent on equalization payments‚Äîunfortunately.  

however, there is tremendous economic potential in investing in the people of bornholm. for example, improving the well-being of just 10 percent of public school students could generate a minimum of 83 million kroner in municipal revenue over a lifetime. on top of that, we would see reduced expenses as a result of improved well-being.  

the future of bornholm depends on its people and their welfare‚Äînot on fanciful projects that divert funding away from what we know works.  

but to start, politicians need to tell the truth as it is‚Äînot as they wish it were.

6089,1/13/2025 11:58:48,"Energy Islands, from the Right Angle
1- Going Offshore:
Offshore wind energy generation is more efficient than on land, to harness it you‚Äôd have to follow the wind. Ocean water currents offer a much higher energy density, at a stable rate, the technology is progressing, to harness you‚Äôd have to follow the currents. 
To make Hydrogen Green, sea water reverse osmosis and electrolysis equipment have to be close to an energy source, from here the idea of Energy Islands begins. 
2-Locations:
Energy Islands should be near the winds, waves and currents. The Baltic Sea average depth is 50 m, the North Sea 90 m, the Mediterranean Sea 1,500 m, the Atlantic Ocean 3,600 m.
3-Requirements: 
Energy Islands should be accessible all year long. Offshore rigs personnel have to go through extensive safety training to be allowed to make the trip by Helicopter or by Offshore Support Vessels, both ways are expensive and at high risk.
Energy Islands should cater for additional space when an Wind Farm expands; and permit ergonomic maintenance and replacement of equipment without the use of heavy lift Floating Marine Cranes and Floating Docks.
4-Logistics:
Energy Islands service and operations teams may range from dozens to hundreds. This team require fresh water supply, food supply, cold service water, hot service water, wastewater disposal, solid waste disposal and regular rotation.  Offshore supply and retrieval trips made by Offshore Supply Vessels is dangerous and expensive in high seas.
5-Backfilling:
Supposing a nation wishes to build an Energy Island by backfilling into the sea within its economic water zone; the currents within this sea would have to be studied not to alter direction and affect neighboring nations, the sediments from the backfilling process would be carried to undesirable locations within the nation shoreline, or to neighboring shoreline, affecting marine fauna and flora. A thorough Environmental Impact Assessment should be endorsed by all nation stakeholders.
Assuming an EIA is approved, lets look at the backfilling process on a sandy bed at 50 m seawater depth. If the surface footprint of the island is to be 500m x 500m, the scour protection measures, whatever the method used, would have a footprint of around 600m x 600m at sea bed level. The offshore contracting operations would have to be carried out within the yearly calm season, if the entire operation, or the milestone target construction is not achieved within the first season, the sea would destroy and remove most of it before the next season.
 After completion, if a structural failure occurs, under rough sea conditions, repairs would have to wait till the calm season, at the risk of further uncontrollable damage.
Once such Energy Island is completed, installing equipment on top would follow any port procedures; if certain components need to be replaced, they would have to be lifted and transported onto a vessel.
While this enormous offshore marine contracting job maybe concluded at 50m depth, will let the reader imagine the 90m or 1,500m sea depth scenario feasibility.
6-Floating Energy Island:
A Floating Island is fabricated in a shipyard, launched to sea, tugged to the desired location, and anchored. The process is carried in a controlled environment, irrespective of sea state and sea depth.
While many Floating Island solutions are marketed, and most developers submitted their design to the UN Habitat in 2018 in a New York meeting, none of their literature is conclusive, most of it is at conceptual level. 
The only solution that passed Two Marine Societies design approval by Bureau Veritas (France) in 2005 and International Naval Survey Bureau (Greece) in 2009, and a thorough Marine Society design, engineering, procurement and fabrication survey by INSB from 2009 till 2015 is the one made by Dr. Abdullah Daou, the founder of Beirut International Marine Industry and Commerce. 
Beirut International‚Äôs Floating Island first prototype was made in 1997, at a scale of 1:10 measuring 4m x 4m, was extensively tested in a make shift water basin, with better than expected stability results under high simulated waves condition.
 In 2009 the fabrication of the first Floating Island made by Beirut International started in Lebanon. The substructure base 48m wide, by 76m long, 9m deep and weighing around 4,000 tons was being assembled in Tripoli Shipyard, while structural components where being fabricated in three other workshops in Lebanon by a team of 431 local technicians and engineers. 
While the fate of this structure was unfortunate, Ninety-Eight Million US Dollars were invested in the research, development and fabrication; a 70% completion rate was achieved, almost all drawings approved and stamped by INSB meeting SOLAS and other marine regulations. 
The learning curve is priceless. The technology is ready, far ahead of any contender. True, a full-scale prototype is yet to be made again and tested.
7-Pros:
A Floating Energy Island is modular, making it scalable to meet any Offshore Wind Farm expansion. If maintenance is requires, a module can be detached, tugged to a shipyard then re-connected.
The substructure of a Floating Energy Island is transparent to the sea, making it an artificial coral reef for marine life, and simultaneously providing anchoring points to install Water Current Energy makers. 
The waves are absorbed and damped by the Floating Energy Island, creating a calm water area at the rear port for Vessel to approach and dock at ease, allowing for safe and friendly access. 
Being a generator of Hydrogen, and having a large underwater space, it is an ideal location to develop sustainable fisheries, creating an additional export income.
Solid waste composting and wastewater treatment available technologies can make some agriculture a sustainable alternative to waste disposal.
The Hydrogen process being noiseless, and clean; a Yacht Club can be safe haven for yachts sailing across seas and oceans.
8-Cons:
Beirut International claims are yet to be tested.
9-Joint Venture:
The Hydrogen Environment is relatively new. 
Stakeholders include: Shipping Companies, Energy Companies, Ports Logistics, Telecommunication, Reverse Osmosis Water Makers, Electroliser Makers, Wind Turbine makers, Wave Energy Makers, Current Energy Makers, Shipyards, Marine Offshore Contractors, Hydrogen Storage Solution Makers, Inverters, Controls, Aquaponics, Wastewater Treatment, Solid Waste Treatment‚Ä¶ 
While some stakeholders are more advanced then the other, some at prototyping stage, other at maturity; a Floating Energy Island success needs their close collaboration. A fresh firm in the Legal field is trying to advise stakeholders to join efforts and Joint Venture to make such infrastructure and energy concepts a needed reality to meet a Marine Decarbonization.",Other,"actor:

energy islands should cater for additional space when an wind farm expands; and permit ergonomic maintenance and replacement of equipment without the use of heavy lift floating marine cranes and floating docks.

energy islands service and operations teams may range from dozens to hundreds. this team require fresh water supply, food supply, cold service water, hot service water, wastewater disposal, solid waste disposal and regular rotation.  offshore supply and retrieval trips made by offshore supply vessels is dangerous and expensive in high seas.

supposing a nation wishes to build an energy island by backfilling into the sea within its economic water zone; the currents within this sea would have to be studied not to alter direction and affect neighboring nations, the sediments from the backfilling process would be carried to undesirable locations within the nation shoreline, or to neighboring shoreline, affecting marine fauna and flora. a thorough environmental impact assessment should be endorsed by all nation stakeholders.
assuming an eia is approved, lets look at the backfilling process on a sandy bed at 50 m seawater depth. if the surface footprint of the island is to be 500m x 500m, the scour protection measures, whatever the method used, would have a footprint of around 600m x 600m at sea bed level. the offshore contracting operations would have to be carried out within the yearly calm season, if the entire operation, or the milestone target construction is not achieved within the first season, the sea would destroy and remove most of it before the next season.
 after completion, if a structural failure occurs, under rough sea conditions, repairs would have to wait till the calm season, at the risk of further uncontrollable damage.
once such energy island is completed, installing equipment on top would follow any port procedures; if certain components need to be replaced, they would have to be lifted and transported onto a vessel.
while this enormous offshore marine contracting job maybe concluded at 50m depth, will let the reader imagine the 90m or 1,500m sea depth scenario feasibility.

a floating island is fabricated in a shipyard, launched to sea, tugged to the desired location, and anchored. the process is carried in a controlled environment, irrespective of sea state and sea depth.
while many floating island solutions are marketed, and most developers submitted their design to the un habitat in 2018 in a new york meeting, none of their literature is conclusive, most of it is at conceptual level. 
the only solution that passed two marine societies design approval by bureau veritas  in 2005 and international naval survey bureau in 2009, and a thorough marine society design, engineering, procurement and fabrication survey by insb from 2009 till 2015 is the one made by dr. abdullah daou, the founder of beirut international marine industry and commerce. 
beirut international‚Äôs floating island first prototype was made in 1997, at a scale of 1:10 measuring 4m x 4m, was extensively tested in a make shift water basin, with better than expected stability results under high simulated waves condition.

in 2009 the fabrication of the first floating island made by beirut international started in lebanon. the substructure base 48m wide, by 76m long, 9m deep and weighing around 4,000 tons was being assembled in tripoli shipyard, while structural components where being fabricated in three other workshops in lebanon by a team of 431 local technicians and engineers. 
while the fate of this structure was unfortunate, ninety-eight million us dollars were invested in the research, development and fabrication; a 70% completion rate was achieved, almost all drawings approved and stamped by insb meeting solas and other marine regulations. 
the learning curve is priceless. the technology is ready, far ahead of any contender. true, a full-scale prototype is yet to be made again and tested.


there is seven pros for building the energy islands.
a floating energy island is modular, making it scalable to meet any offshore wind farm expansion. if maintenance is requires, a module can be detached, tugged to a shipyard then re-connected.
the substructure of a floating energy island is transparent to the sea, making it an artificial coral reef for marine life, and simultaneously providing anchoring points to install water current energy makers. 
the waves are absorbed and damped by the floating energy island, creating a calm water area at the rear port for vessel to approach and dock at ease, allowing for safe and friendly access. 
being a generator of hydrogen, and having a large underwater space, it is an ideal location to develop sustainable fisheries, creating an additional export income.
solid waste composting and wastewater treatment available technologies can make some agriculture a sustainable alternative to waste disposal.
the hydrogen process being noiseless, and clean; a yacht club can be safe haven for yachts sailing across seas and oceans.

however the cons of building the islands are yet to be tested by our firm.

the hydrogen environment is relatively new. 
stakeholders include: shipping companies, energy companies, ports logistics, telecommunication, reverse osmosis water makers, electroliser makers, wind turbine makers, wave energy makers, current energy makers, shipyards, marine offshore contractors, hydrogen storage solution makers, inverters, controls, aquaponics, wastewater treatment, solid waste treatment‚Ä¶ 
while some stakeholders are more advanced then the other, some at prototyping stage, other at maturity; a floating energy island success needs their close collaboration. a fresh firm in the legal field is trying to advise stakeholders to join efforts and joint venture to make such infrastructure and energy concepts a needed reality to meet a marine decarbonization.",1/11/2023,https://www.facebook.com/BeirutInternational/posts/729897881691280/,Facebook,Company website,2023,1502.615723,-148.384384,Marine life and evironmental impact of constructing energy islands,True,Here

‚ÄòAny artificial island has potential change a seabed from a homogeneous ‚Äúdesert‚Äù to a new biodiverse ‚Äúoasis‚Äù‚Äô, says Nicholas Grunnet, coastal engineering specialist at DHI.

'Different aspects of artificial islands can enhance ecosystem designs:

‚úÖArtificial islands with vertical walls would work well for a few species, like marine mussels
‚úÖUsing stone groynes and breakwaters can act as local reefs at shallower depths (0-10m)
‚úÖStone cover in deeper depths (>10m) can create habitats for fish, lobsters and macro algae
‚úÖSand beaches can even act as resting spots for seals'

The first energy island is currently being planned 100 km offshore of Denmark in the North Sea to harvest three gigawatts of power from surrounding wind farms.

6801,1/13/2025 14:19:50,"Energy Islands, from the Right Angle
1- Going Offshore:
Offshore wind energy generation is more efficient than on land, to harness it you‚Äôd have to follow the wind. Ocean water currents offer a much higher energy density, at a stable rate, the technology is progressing, to harness you‚Äôd have to follow the currents.
To make Hydrogen Green, sea water reverse osmosis and electrolysis equipment have to be close to an energy source, from here the idea of Energy Islands begins.
2-Locations:
Energy Islands should be near the winds, waves and currents. The Baltic Sea average depth is 50 m, the North Sea 90 m, the Mediterranean Sea 1,500 m, the Atlantic Ocean 3,600 m.
3-Requirements:
Energy Islands should be accessible all year long. Offshore rigs personnel have to go through extensive safety training to be allowed to make the trip by Helicopter or by Offshore Support Vessels, both ways are expensive and at high risk.
Energy Islands should cater for additional space when an Wind Farm expands; and permit ergonomic maintenance and replacement of equipment without the use of heavy lift Floating Marine Cranes and Floating Docks.
4-Logistics:
Energy Islands service and operations teams may range from dozens to hundreds. This team require fresh water supply, food supply, cold service water, hot service water, wastewater disposal, solid waste disposal and regular rotation. Offshore supply and retrieval trips made by Offshore Supply Vessels is dangerous and expensive in high seas.
5-Backfilling:
Supposing a nation wishes to build an Energy Island by backfilling into the sea within its economic water zone; the currents within this sea would have to be studied not to alter direction and affect neighboring nations, the sediments from the backfilling process would be carried to undesirable locations within the nation shoreline, or to neighboring shoreline, affecting marine fauna and flora. A thorough Environmental Impact Assessment should be endorsed by all nation stakeholders.
Assuming an EIA is approved, lets look at the backfilling process on a sandy bed at 50 m seawater depth. If the surface footprint of the island is to be 500m x 500m, the scour protection measures, whatever the method used, would have a footprint of around 600m x 600m at sea bed level. The offshore contracting operations would have to be carried out within the yearly calm season, if the entire operation, or the milestone target construction is not achieved within the first season, the sea would destroy and remove most of it before the next season.
After completion, if a structural failure occurs, under rough sea conditions, repairs would have to wait till the calm season, at the risk of further uncontrollable damage.
Once such Energy Island is completed, installing equipment on top would follow any port procedures; if certain components need to be replaced, they would have to be lifted and transported onto a vessel.
While this enormous offshore marine contracting job maybe concluded at 50m depth, will let the reader imagine the 90m or 1,500m sea depth scenario feasibility.
6-Floating Energy Island:
A Floating Island is fabricated in a shipyard, launched to sea, tugged to the desired location, and anchored. The process is carried in a controlled environment, irrespective of sea state and sea depth.
While many Floating Island solutions are marketed, and most developers submitted their design to the UN Habitat in 2018 in a New York meeting, none of their literature is conclusive, most of it is at conceptual level.
The only solution that passed Two Marine Societies design approval by Bureau Veritas (France) in 2005 and International Naval Survey Bureau (Greece) in 2009, and a thorough Marine Society design, engineering, procurement and fabrication survey by INSB from 2009 till 2015 is the one made by Dr. Abdullah Daou, the founder of Beirut International Marine Industry and Commerce.
Beirut International‚Äôs Floating Island first prototype was made in 1997, at a scale of 1:10 measuring 4m x 4m, was extensively tested in a make shift water basin, with better than expected stability results under high simulated waves condition.
In 2009 the fabrication of the first Floating Island made by Beirut International started in Lebanon. The substructure base 48m wide, by 76m long, 9m deep and weighing around 4,000 tons was being assembled in Tripoli Shipyard, while structural components where being fabricated in three other workshops in Lebanon by a team of 431 local technicians and engineers.
While the fate of this structure was unfortunate, Ninety-Eight Million US Dollars were invested in the research, development and fabrication; a 70% completion rate was achieved, almost all drawings approved and stamped by INSB meeting SOLAS and other marine regulations.
The learning curve is priceless. The technology is ready, far ahead of any contender. True, a full-scale prototype is yet to be made again and tested.
7-Pros:
A Floating Energy Island is modular, making it scalable to meet any Offshore Wind Farm expansion. If maintenance is requires, a module can be detached, tugged to a shipyard then re-connected.
The substructure of a Floating Energy Island is transparent to the sea, making it an artificial coral reef for marine life, and simultaneously providing anchoring points to install Water Current Energy makers.
The waves are absorbed and damped by the Floating Energy Island, creating a calm water area at the rear port for Vessel to approach and dock at ease, allowing for safe and friendly access.
Being a generator of Hydrogen, and having a large underwater space, it is an ideal location to develop sustainable fisheries, creating an additional export income.
Solid waste composting and wastewater treatment available technologies can make some agriculture a sustainable alternative to waste disposal.
The Hydrogen process being noiseless, and clean; a Yacht Club can be safe haven for yachts sailing across seas and oceans.
8-Cons:
Beirut International claims are yet to be tested.
9-Joint Venture:
The Hydrogen Environment is relatively new.
Stakeholders include: Shipping Companies, Energy Companies, Ports Logistics, Telecommunication, Reverse Osmosis Water Makers, Electroliser Makers, Wind Turbine makers, Wave Energy Makers, Current Energy Makers, Shipyards, Marine Offshore Contractors, Hydrogen Storage Solution Makers, Inverters, Controls, Aquaponics, Wastewater Treatment, Solid Waste Treatment‚Ä¶
While some stakeholders are more advanced then the other, some at prototyping stage, other at maturity; a Floating Energy Island success needs their close collaboration. A fresh firm in the Legal field is trying to advise stakeholders to join efforts and Joint Venture to make such infrastructure and energy concepts a needed reality to meet a Marine Decarbonization.",Other,"offshore wind energy generation is more efficient than onshore because it allows the ability to follow the wind, and ocean water currents offer even higher energy density at a stable rate. as technology advances, the ability to harness these currents is becoming more feasible. to produce green hydrogen, seawater reverse osmosis and electrolysis equipment needs to be positioned close to an energy source, which is where the concept of energy islands comes into play.

energy islands should be located near strong wind, wave, and current sources. for example, the baltic sea has an average depth of 50m, the north sea reaches 90m, the mediterranean sea is at 1,500m, and the atlantic ocean goes as deep as 3,600m.

these islands must be accessible throughout the year. personnel working on offshore rigs must undergo extensive safety training to travel by helicopter or offshore support vessel, both of which are costly and carry high risk. additionally, energy islands should provide space for future wind farm expansions and allow for ergonomic maintenance and the replacement of equipment without needing heavy lift floating marine cranes or floating docks.

energy islands will require service and operations teams, potentially numbering from dozens to hundreds of people. these teams will need fresh water, food, cold and hot service water, wastewater disposal, solid waste disposal, and regular rotation. the logistics of offshore supply trips via offshore supply vessels are dangerous and expensive, especially when seas are rough.

if a nation decides to build an energy island by backfilling into its own economic water zone, the currents in the area must be carefully studied to avoid affecting neighboring countries. the sediments displaced by backfilling could be carried to undesirable locations, potentially harming marine life along nearby shorelines. a comprehensive environmental impact assessment (eia) must be completed and approved by all relevant stakeholders. 

assuming the eia is approved, the backfilling process itself presents significant challenges. for example, building an island with a surface footprint of 500m by 500m at a depth of 50m would require scour protection measures that would extend the footprint to around 600m by 600m at the seabed level. the entire backfilling operation must be completed during the calm season, or much of the progress would be destroyed by sea conditions. if a structural failure occurs, repairs could only be made during the calm season, risking further damage.

a floating energy island, by contrast, is constructed in a shipyard, launched to sea, tugged to its desired location, and anchored. this process can be carried out in a controlled environment, unaffected by sea conditions or depth. although many floating island solutions are marketed, none have been fully proven. the only solution that has received design approval from both bureau veritas (france) in 2005 and the international naval survey bureau (greece) in 2009, as well as undergoing extensive design, engineering, and fabrication surveys by insb from 2009 to 2015, is the design developed by dr. abdullah daou, the founder of beirut international marine industry and commerce.

beirut international‚Äôs first prototype of a floating energy island was developed in 1997 at a 1:10 scale (measuring 4m by 4m) and tested extensively in a makeshift water basin, yielding better-than-expected stability results under high simulated waves. in 2009, the company began fabricating the first full-sized floating island in lebanon. the substructure, measuring 48m wide, 76m long, and 9m deep, weighed around 4,000 tons and was being assembled in tripoli shipyard. the project involved 431 local engineers and technicians. despite the unfortunate fate of this structure, the project represented a $98 million investment, with a 70% completion rate achieved, and most drawings were approved in accordance with solas and other marine regulations.

the lessons learned from this project are invaluable, and the technology is now ready, well ahead of any competitor. although a full-scale prototype has yet to be built and tested again, the floating island concept is proven to be scalable, modular, and adaptable to offshore wind farm expansions. should maintenance be required, individual modules can be detached, towed to a shipyard for repairs, and reconnected. the substructure of a floating energy island is transparent to the sea, creating an artificial coral reef that supports marine life and provides anchoring points for water current energy systems. furthermore, the waves are absorbed by the floating island, creating calm water areas at the rear port for safe docking of vessels.

in addition to generating hydrogen, these islands have vast underwater space, making them ideal for developing sustainable fisheries, which could create additional export income. technologies for solid waste composting, wastewater treatment, and even aquaponics could make the islands self-sufficient and sustainable. the hydrogen production process itself is quiet and clean, providing a safe haven for yachts as they traverse the seas and oceans.

however, it is important to note that beirut international‚Äôs claims are yet to be fully tested. 

the hydrogen environment remains a relatively new field, and success in floating energy island development requires the close collaboration of numerous stakeholders, including shipping companies, energy companies, ports logistics, telecommunication firms, reverse osmosis and electrolysis equipment manufacturers, wind turbine producers, wave and current energy makers, shipyards, marine offshore contractors, hydrogen storage solution providers, inverters, control systems, aquaponics developers, and waste treatment experts. although some stakeholders are more advanced in their technology than others, and some are still in the prototyping stage, a successful floating energy island requires their combined efforts, possibly in the form of a joint venture to make this critical marine decarbonization infrastructure a reality.",9/13/2022,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=729897881691280,Facebook,Social media,2022,2058.328857,-479.146698,Marine life and evironmental impact of constructing energy islands,True,Positive
6804,1/13/2025 14:55:04,"So the danish minister of energy knows well that the energy island of Bornholm is a loss-making business, and yet it is not taken off the wall, and why should the energy island of the North Sea not be a loss-making business or, for that matter, the latest offer of 6 GW of offshore wind in the North Sea.
Energy island Bornholm is in reality an offshore wind farm, originally at 2 GW and budgeted by Cowi at DKK 39.4 billion, and at the same time the energy island North Sea was budgeted at DKK 52.8 billion for 3 GW. Since then, the Bornholm offshore wind farm was increased to DKK 70 billion for 3 GW, and this should also apply to the North Sea energy island plus DKK 5.6 billion for the caisson island. Relative to the North Sea energy island fully developed to 10 GW, it will have to be budgeted at DKK 233.333 billion plus DKK 10.9 billion for the caisson island. As a steel platform, 3 GW will have to be budgeted at DKK 76.4 billion and 10 GW DKK 319.933 billion due to more expensive electrical installations.
[link]
In the meantime, 1 GW offshore wind turbines have become 5.111 billion kroner more expensive, so corrected for the price increase, offshore wind farm Bornholm will have to be budgeted at 85.333 billion kroner for 3 GW and energy island North Sea as steel platforms at 371.004 billion kroner for 10 GW.
A total construction budget of DKK 456.377 billion for offshore wind turbines, which will be technically and financially exhausted for replacement in 30 years, apart from perhaps electrical installations and the caisson island and electrical installations for DKK 141.8 billion. If they are realized despite the lack of profitability, 912.754 billion current kroner will have been invested in the two offshore wind turbine projects in sixty years.
If they want to get a capacity factor of 60%, they will generate 7.8 GW, which corresponds to a nuclear power capacity of 8.667 GW and a construction budget of 929.443 billion, if Hinkley Point C should end up costing 107.239 billion kroner / GW.
It is generally recognized that solar and wind power entail greater costs for additional adjustable capacity and for changing the electricity grid than nuclear power does, as it is technologically equivalent to today's thermal cogeneration plants, which today should be 6 GW, apart from the source for boiling water .
Apparently a dead race between the two technologies, if nuclear power over the coming ones will reap the economies of scale that solar and wind power have already reaped in full.

Economic advisors call for ""reconsideration"" of Danish energy island",Facebook user,"i believe the danish government is fully aware that the bornholm energy island is a loss-making project, yet it hasn‚Äôt been scrapped. so why should the north sea energy island, or the new 6 gw offshore wind project in the north sea, be any different? the bornholm project, which started as a 2 gw offshore wind farm, was initially budgeted at dkk 39.4 billion, but has now ballooned to dkk 70 billion for just 3 gw. the north sea energy island, originally estimated at dkk 52.8 billion for 3 gw, will likely cost dkk 233.333 billion for 10 gw. and if it's built as a steel platform, the cost could rise to dkk 319.933 billion. with the cost of 1 gw of offshore wind turbines increasing by 5.111 billion kroner, the bornholm project could end up costing dkk 85.333 billion for 3 gw, while the north sea energy island as steel platforms could reach dkk 371.004 billion for 10 gw. this brings the total construction budget for both projects to around dkk 456.377 billion, not including additional costs for electrical installations and caisson islands. over 60 years, the combined investment in these two projects could reach nearly 913 billion kroner, but it‚Äôs unclear if they will ever be profitable. compared to nuclear power, which may have lower overall costs, particularly with the economies of scale it could achieve, i wonder if these wind projects are really the best option. wind and solar power come with high costs for additional capacity and grid changes, while nuclear power, which is similar to today‚Äôs thermal plants, could end up being more cost-effective in the long run.",10/9/2024,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1698055787360091/posts/1955915294907471/,Facebook,Social media,2024,-979.484314,-446.857849,Are there more cost-effective ways to reach the emissions targets?,True,Negative

7081,1/15/2025 9:52:03,"""Energy Islands, from the Right Angle
1- Going Offshore:
Offshore wind energy generation is more efficient than on land, to harness it you‚Äôd have to follow the wind. Ocean water currents offer a much higher energy density, at a stable rate, the technology is progressing, to harness you‚Äôd have to follow the currents. 
To make Hydrogen Green, sea water reverse osmosis and electrolysis equipment have to be close to an energy source, from here the idea of Energy Islands begins. 
2-Locations:
Energy Islands should be near the winds, waves and currents. The Baltic Sea average depth is 50 m, the North Sea 90 m, the Mediterranean Sea 1,500 m, the Atlantic Ocean 3,600 m.
3-Requirements: 
Energy Islands should be accessible all year long. Offshore rigs personnel have to go through extensive safety training to be allowed to make the trip by Helicopter or by Offshore Support Vessels, both ways are expensive and at high risk.
Energy Islands should cater for additional space when an Wind Farm expands; and permit ergonomic maintenance and replacement of equipment without the use of heavy lift Floating Marine Cranes and Floating Docks.
4-Logistics:
Energy Islands service and operations teams may range from dozens to hundreds. This team require fresh water supply, food supply, cold service water, hot service water, wastewater disposal, solid waste disposal and regular rotation.  Offshore supply and retrieval trips made by Offshore Supply Vessels is dangerous and expensive in high seas.
5-Backfilling:
Supposing a nation wishes to build an Energy Island by backfilling into the sea within its economic water zone; the currents within this sea would have to be studied not to alter direction and affect neighboring nations, the sediments from the backfilling process would be carried to undesirable locations within the nation shoreline, or to neighboring shoreline, affecting marine fauna and flora. A thorough Environmental Impact Assessment should be endorsed by all nation stakeholders.
Assuming an EIA is approved, lets look at the backfilling process on a sandy bed at 50 m seawater depth. If the surface footprint of the island is to be 500m x 500m, the scour protection measures, whatever the method used, would have a footprint of around 600m x 600m at sea bed level. The offshore contracting operations would have to be carried out within the yearly calm season, if the entire operation, or the milestone target construction is not achieved within the first season, the sea would destroy and remove most of it before the next season.
 After completion, if a structural failure occurs, under rough sea conditions, repairs would have to wait till the calm season, at the risk of further uncontrollable damage.
Once such Energy Island is completed, installing equipment on top would follow any port procedures; if certain components need to be replaced, they would have to be lifted and transported onto a vessel.
While this enormous offshore marine contracting job maybe concluded at 50m depth, will let the reader imagine the 90m or 1,500m sea depth scenario feasibility.
6-Floating Energy Island:
A Floating Island is fabricated in a shipyard, launched to sea, tugged to the desired location, and anchored. The process is carried in a controlled environment, irrespective of sea state and sea depth.
While many Floating Island solutions are marketed, and most developers submitted their design to the UN Habitat in 2018 in a New York meeting, none of their literature is conclusive, most of it is at conceptual level. 
The only solution that passed Two Marine Societies design approval by Bureau Veritas (France) in 2005 and International Naval Survey Bureau (Greece) in 2009, and a thorough Marine Society design, engineering, procurement and fabrication survey by INSB from 2009 till 2015 is the one made by Dr. Abdullah Daou, the founder of Beirut International Marine Industry and Commerce. 
Beirut International‚Äôs Floating Island first prototype was made in 1997, at a scale of 1:10 measuring 4m x 4m, was extensively tested in a make shift water basin, with better than expected stability results under high simulated waves condition.
 In 2009 the fabrication of the first Floating Island made by Beirut International started in Lebanon. The substructure base 48m wide, by 76m long, 9m deep and weighing around 4,000 tons was being assembled in Tripoli Shipyard, while structural components where being fabricated in three other workshops in Lebanon by a team of 431 local technicians and engineers. 
While the fate of this structure was unfortunate, Ninety-Eight Million US Dollars were invested in the research, development and fabrication; a 70% completion rate was achieved, almost all drawings approved and stamped by INSB meeting SOLAS and other marine regulations. 
The learning curve is priceless. The technology is ready, far ahead of any contender. True, a full-scale prototype is yet to be made again and tested.
7-Pros:
A Floating Energy Island is modular, making it scalable to meet any Offshore Wind Farm expansion. If maintenance is requires, a module can be detached, tugged to a shipyard then re-connected.
The substructure of a Floating Energy Island is transparent to the sea, making it an artificial coral reef for marine life, and simultaneously providing anchoring points to install Water Current Energy makers. 
The waves are absorbed and damped by the Floating Energy Island, creating a calm water area at the rear port for Vessel to approach and dock at ease, allowing for safe and friendly access. 
Being a generator of Hydrogen, and having a large underwater space, it is an ideal location to develop sustainable fisheries, creating an additional export income.
Solid waste composting and wastewater treatment available technologies can make some agriculture a sustainable alternative to waste disposal.
The Hydrogen process being noiseless, and clean; a Yacht Club can be safe haven for yachts sailing across seas and oceans.
8-Cons:
Beirut International claims are yet to be tested.
9-Joint Venture:
The Hydrogen Environment is relatively new. 
Stakeholders include: Shipping Companies, Energy Companies, Ports Logistics, Telecommunication, Reverse Osmosis Water Makers, Electroliser Makers, Wind Turbine makers, Wave Energy Makers, Current Energy Makers, Shipyards, Marine Offshore Contractors, Hydrogen Storage Solution Makers, Inverters, Controls, Aquaponics, Wastewater Treatment, Solid Waste Treatment‚Ä¶ 
While some stakeholders are more advanced then the other, some at prototyping stage, other at maturity; a Floating Energy Island success needs their close collaboration.

the company emphasizes that building energy islands requires extensive logistical planning due to the harsh and dangerous conditions of the sea. the construction process involves complex backfilling and the need for thorough environmental impact assessments. offshore supply and service operations are expensive, high-risk, and must be timed for calm seasons to avoid destructive sea conditions.

beirut international advocates for floating energy islands, which can be constructed in controlled environments like shipyards and are then towed to their final locations. the company highlights that its floating energy island design is the only one to have passed rigorous approval by international marine societies, including bureau veritas and the international naval survey bureau, after years of testing and development. a prototype was created in 1997, and a more advanced version began fabrication in 2009, with 70% completion. despite setbacks, beirut international maintains that its technology is ready and far ahead of other competitors in the field.

the floating energy island design is modular, scalable, and capable of supporting offshore wind farms while also promoting marine life and offering an ideal space for hydrogen production. the structure's substation is transparent to the sea, creating an artificial coral reef, and it can also host sustainable fisheries and generate additional revenue through agriculture and waste treatment technologies. additionally, the hydrogen production process is silent, making it a potential hub for yachts and vessels to dock safely.

beirut international acknowledges that the claims around floating energy islands have yet to be fully tested, but believes they are a key part of a sustainable, marine-based decarbonization strategy. the company encourages collaboration among various stakeholders in the marine and energy sectors to realize the potential of this groundbreaking infrastructure and meet future energy demands.",12/9/2022,https://www.facebook.com/BeirutInternational/posts/544090527918648/,Facebook,Social media,2022,2056.216797,-605.06604,Marine life and evironmental impact of constructing energy islands,True,positive

7181,1/15/2025 11:05:01,"For nogle dage siden skrev jeg om forskellige passive sikkerhedspolitiske tiltag, som b√∏r foretages i EU som helhed, indenfor omr√•derne IT, decentrale autonome energisystemer, r√•stofgenbrug, indvinding og bearbejdning samt landbrug.
Her vil jeg uddybe landbrug i relation til decentrale energisystemer.
Tanken er et koncept, som jeg vil kalde ""energi√∏er p√• land"". Alts√• et omr√•de, hvor der foreg√•r nogle f√• udvekslinger med omverdenen (import eksport), men hvor langt den st√∏rste del af informationsudvekslinger og energiudvekslinger sker internt p√• ""energi√∏en"". 
Man kan naturligvis stadig ramme s√•dan en ""energi√∏"" med nogle missiler, eller hacking, men omvendt kan man ogs√• forsvare et lokaliseret omr√•de milit√¶rt set, ligesom man med passende sandboxing-teknologier kan undg√• nedlukning. Da informationsudvekslingerne med omverdenen er begr√¶nsede, er det relativt enkelt at beskytte sig mod de fleste hacking fors√∏g ved at v√¶lge redundante systemer med uafh√¶ngige informationssystemer, som i sidste ende kan overtages af manuel regulering og eller GAI-regulering p√• lokale enheder uden internet. 
Den centrale ide er, at hvis decentraliserede produktionsenheder omtr√¶der i stort tal i hele EU, bliver m√¶ngden af m√•l uoverskuelig stor for en fjendtlig aggressor, s√• det skaber en barriere mod at angribe.
Hvad kunne der eksempelvis v√¶re p√• s√•dan en energi√∏? Det kunne v√¶re centreret omkring et biogasanl√¶g uden tilslutning til naturgasnettet, hvor man metaniserer naturgassen (omdanner CO2 til metan ved at tils√¶tte brint), reformerer metanen til syntesegas, som reformeres videre til e-metanol. Man kan kombinere med ting som gr√∏nt planteprotein og forgasning eller pyrolyse, for at optimere √∏konomisk samt for at energioptimere.
Import/eksport kan opdeles i lokale og globale produkter. Lokale import-produkter kan v√¶re el fra solceller og vindm√∏ller omkring energi√∏en (direct line, hvor man ikke kommer p√• det overordnede elnet), import af gylle, kl√∏vergr√¶s og h√∏stede efterafgr√∏der. Lokale eksportprodukter kan v√¶re gr√∏n planteprotein, afgasset gylle (digestat), gyllefibre, eddikesyre, metan, metanol og DME samt pyrolyseprodukter (herunder pyrolyseolie og eller gas).
Global import kan v√¶re el (n√•r det kan importes billgt), mens globale eksportprodukter kan v√¶re s√•dan noget som el, planteprotein, gyllefibre, metanol og biokoks.
Det elegante ved modellen er ikke kun, at det sikrer bedre forsyningssikkerhed, men ogs√• at det erstatter importerede landbrugsprodukter af central betydning (sojafoder og kemisk kv√¶lstofg√∏dning) med lokalt producerede produkter (gr√∏nt planteprotein og kv√¶lstoffiksering), og derved sikrer dels en st√∏rre lokal landbrugsproduktion, men ogs√• nogle lokale v√¶kstcentre i landbrugsomr√•der, men ret store kompetenceopbygninger.
Det er en bonusvirkning, at det giver mulighed for en meget omfattende udbygning med vind, sol, biogas og PtX uden at kr√¶ve omfattende ny infrastruktur, s√•som energi√∏er i Nords√∏en, internationale brintnet osv. Samtidig er der store klimaproblemer med sojafoder og kemisk kv√¶lstofg√∏dning, ligesom sojafoder konkurrerer med traditionel regnskov. Vi importerer is√¶r soja fra de amerikanske kontinenter, USA og Kina.",Facebook user,"form_responses
 
 	
i believe that the eu should adopt a decentralized approach to energy production and security, which i term ""land-based energy islands."" these are localized zones with limited external exchanges, primarily self-sufficient in energy and information flows. this model enhances resilience against missile attacks, hacking, and other threats through military defendability and sandboxing technologies that prevent system-wide failures. redundant and independent systems can allow manual or local ai-driven regulation without relying on the internet.

the widespread implementation of such decentralized units across the eu would overwhelm any hostile aggressor with an unmanageable number of targets, thereby discouraging attacks. a land-based energy island could revolve around a biogas plant disconnected from the natural gas grid, using technologies like methanation, reforming methane into syngas and e-methanol, and combining processes like pyrolysis or green plant protein production for economic and energy efficiency.

imports and exports would differentiate between local and global exchanges. locally, these could include electricity from nearby solar and wind installations, manure, clover grass, and harvested cover crops, while exports might comprise green plant protein, digested manure, methane, methanol, and pyrolysis products like oil or gas. globally, imports could include electricity when cheap, and exports might involve plant protein, methanol, and biocoke.

this model enhances supply security, reduces reliance on imported agricultural products like soy feed and chemical fertilizers, and substitutes them with locally produced alternatives such as green plant protein and nitrogen fixation. it boosts local agricultural production, creates growth hubs in rural areas, and facilitates competence-building in these regions.

moreover, this approach allows for a significant expansion of renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and biogas without requiring extensive new infrastructure such as north sea energy islands or international hydrogen networks. it also addresses the climate issues associated with imported soy feed and chemical fertilizers, which contribute to deforestation and other environmental concerns. by reducing dependency on imports from the americas, the u.s., and china, we can create a more sustainable and secure energy and agricultural system.",1/9/2025,https://www.facebook.com/stig.libori/posts/pfbid02Ru98vxCiCXog4Hpw4Ffz6bMvbkpDNBaHJxythKNkHKbsqi3gN9JPSjcRnLfqZQphl,Facebook,Social media,2025,1543.87561,-1099.171753,Geopolitics and energy independence: can we avoid relying on others for our energy supply?,True,Neither

7188,1/15/2025 11:12:00,"""22-year-old Thomas Vibe Hoffmeyer has just completed a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Design of Sustainable Energy Systems. Throughout his studies, he has acquired skills in the field of sustainable energy transition. He believes such skills can be the key to getting a job where he can make a difference in the world. And that job could possibly be on his native island Bornholm.
Bornholm is a part of a bigger project where the island, along with an artificial island in the North Sea, will be established as an energy island. This means that Bornholm will be in significant development in the nearest future.
‚ÄúI would really like to go back and live on Bornholm again,‚Äù Thomas says.
‚ÄúGiven how much development there‚Äôs going to be, it‚Äôs a real dream scenario. There are huge future opportunities ‚Äì not just for me, but also for Bornholm.‚Äù
In the spring, he went on a study trip to his native island, Bornholm, with his fellow students. The purpose of the trip was to learn about the possibilities of powering the island sustainably.
DTU is currently establishing a so-called Residential College in R√∏nne in collaboration with partners such as the Danish Centre for Green Energy. The plan is that having a base close to where the work is being done will allow students to try out their theoretical knowledge in practice.
And Thomas also sees exciting opportunities for the students when they get to be where knowledge meets reality.
‚ÄúI definitely think that companies can be inspired by the fact that we come in and see the challenges from fresh angles,‚Äù he says.""",Other,"the recent bachelor graduate from dtu states: """"i have completed a bachelor's degree in design of sustainable energy systems, equipping me with skills critical to driving the transition to sustainable energy. these skills, i believe, are essential for securing a role where i can make a meaningful impact. i am particularly drawn to opportunities on my native island, bornholm, which is set to undergo significant development as part of the energy island project. returning to bornholm to live and work is a dream scenario for me. the island‚Äôs transformation offers immense future opportunities‚Äînot only for my career but also for bornholm itself. earlier this year, i visited bornholm on a study trip with fellow students to explore sustainable energy solutions for the island. being involved in such initiatives where theoretical knowledge meets practical challenges is highly inspiring. i see great potential for students like us to contribute fresh perspectives to local companies as we engage directly with real-world problems. the establishment of the residential college in r√∏nne by dtu and partners like the danish centre for green energy is a fantastic step in enabling students to apply their learning in impactful ways.""""",6/22/2022,https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=danish%20energy%20islands,Facebook,Social media,2022,-2922.781738,-726.069824,Who benefits socially and economically from energy islands?
